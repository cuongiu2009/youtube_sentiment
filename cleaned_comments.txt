2: where the hell is baby shark on this list?
3: 6:26 i think we all did man.so many of these are actually such iconic bangers though
4: 9:06 sadly, that song was made low quality on purpose (parody/comedy music), but the people in that time didn&#39;t get the humor and tought it was made in serious. now colibritany an her music is an internet classic, my favorite one is &quot;mami silicon&quot; or &quot;silicon babe&quot;
5: aka top 10 disliked justin bieber songs
6: wehren is wap bap from bibi
7: as a spaniard, i must tell you that ‚Äúpollito p√≠o‚Äù came out before ‚Äúi wanna ride,‚Äù 12 years earlier to be exact.
8: this whole list is fake and bs none of the songs are the most disliked
9: baby is still bad dude.
10: 4:35 , he is right, its a banger &quot;untouchable, untouchableee&quot; but just that part, the rest of the song is ragebait
11: most songs are disliked because they have many views, but margin of like to dislike is hudge
12: the man who made the original video is definitely a justin bieber hater.
13: dont fucking @ me... justin bieber got way better after he got away from the heart throb kid image that was forced on him. love yourself, sorry, stay, ghost, peaches etc... all bangers.
14: i got leafy flashbacks at 8:30 lmao
15: i hate all of them, i was definitely part of the dislikes
16: justin bieber really got better with age his newer stuff is brilliant
17: 6:29 this thing is violating my ears üò≠
18: i will never get justin bieber hatethis dude is so talented and have so many great songs
19: bro just put the most known songs in the video and called them disliked?
20: since it&#39;s just saying &quot;most disliked&quot; it&#39;s just going off the raw amount, not the ratio. if every song had 99% likes, &quot;most disliked&quot; just means &quot;most viewed&quot;. ratio is what really matters. but popularity still matters since there&#39;d be plenty 100% disliked songs that have no views. so what these compilations should really be is &quot;most popular disliked songs&quot;. a.k.a &quot;most popular songs that are ratio&#39;d&quot;. (over 50% dislikes) a.k.a &quot;the most disliked songs, that are actually disliked&quot; (take your pick)
21: e
22: brazilian songs in the list (we&#39;re kinda annoying üò≠üò≠) musicas brasileiras na lista 01:09 metralhadora - vingadora (tays)01:27 baile de favela - mc jo√£o04:50 t√° tranquilo ta favor√°vel - mc bin laden05:25 nhemnhem - maisa08:17 bang - anitta

27: twinkle little star tops all of these
28: probl√©m is that pulcino pio was first bro soooo
29: where was wap bap from bibi with like 2m dislikes????
30: i understand why some songs are disliked. but either this video is half rage bait, or whoever made that video &#39;&#39;the most disliked songs&#39;&#39; is just an full on idiot, or just made is own opinion on songs. because how the fuck are some songs &#39;&#39;disliked&#39;&#39;
31: 4:57 he instant fading the smile and he heartbeat up to 93 in angry lmao

41: notice how there is no beatles songs
42: recking ball drama was about death of hanna montana and birth of new miley i think
43: a little bit of brazilian referenze about music 97, the video doesn&#39;t cover the hate part xd, but basically there was a girl who sings very very badly, alongside this main singer, doing voice like a cattle boiling water xd that&#39;s why it was hated a lot back on the days
44: bebar hater this guy who made this video
45: idk about you but i remember hating on justin bieber so much back in around 4th grade. turns out, his old songs are actually kinda bop and i now feel nostalgic listening to em.
46: nicki minaj‚Äôs ‚Äúsuper bass‚Äù isnt talking about bass, its talking about ‚Äúsuperb ass‚Äù. like she got a phat ass.
47: bro i love the first song, we bumpin ts all summer ‚ù§‚ù§
48: they need to make this video again but highest dislike to like ratio some of these songs are absolute bangers

53: 2:25 banger shakira never misses üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
54: rebecca and justin were fighting demons lowkey
55: 13:06 what transformers guyüò≠
56: yea, all popular songs will have a lot of dislikes, even if it&#39;s a beloved song. being on this list doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything.
57: banger bangher
58: i came into this looking for thick of it
59: where is bibisbeautypalace with how it is?
60: it&#39;s crazy that he looks at all these pop stars with ghost writers and production teams who do everything for them (except sing) and shit like bieber who is literally just an industry plant and think any of it is at all good. it&#39;s all unoriginal trash. it&#39;s like loot boxes. they are fun because they are designed to target the parts of your monkey brain. no different than this over designed shitty pop music.
61: pollito pio is much more older than vegas, vegas was published on 2022 and pollitio pio on 2012
62: admita:voc√™ n√£o esperava ver a ma√≠sa nesse v√≠deo
63: most replayed at 7:58? seriously?
64: 9:36 real!
65: 8:41 never heard this song that‚Äôs crazyyy
66: i cant believe this video made me realize 99% of justin biebers songs really werent that bad
67: the selfie song is the most shitty stuff human has ever created across all the entire human history
68: 19:45 so that&#39;s where jan b√∂hmermann parody&#39;d xd
69: &quot;see you again&quot; hit hard in the cinema
70: 6:00 it&#39;s the &quot;ooh&quot; that&#39;s so annoying
71: randy marsh on 84
72: ahi also totally dont getthat wiggle wiggle shitnglüòπüôàand wtf does little little twinkle star doing herelike wtfü§£
73: ohnepixel&#39;s vibe makes any song better lol
74: iswtg pulcino pio is fire
75: nicki minaj was hated bcuz the videos controversial cuz she shakes butt right
76: so wie photoshop
77: the message to take home is that &quot;more love comes with more hate&quot;
78: the justin beiber hate when i was young was forced. ngl
79: i love &quot;call me maybe&quot; üò¢
80: love how he keeps throwing in random german words lol
81: they should make most dislaked by ratio not total amount
82: everyone had a crush on ariana ohne
83: i never really understand the hate with jb before (i was either too young to understand or just really don&#39;t see him as bad as they portray). anyways, it was before i saw a game in y8 website where you can drag a limpy body of bieber across the screen like hitting him on the walls. now that i have grown up, i realize that bieber was just as young and he went through too much media and audience hate. i feel really sad about thinking about it.
84: warum englisch
85: i get the point why most of them are hated because played in public so many times that hearing that shit for one more time is became unbearable when you are totally fine to play in repeat the same song or playlist for 10 to 20 times, but when it gets played everyday - you just can&#39;t hear it. this isn&#39;t about playes or views, this is about reverse mainstream effect.
86: ok so how did &quot;el pollito pio&quot; copy &quot;vegas&quot; if vegas was released 3 years ago and el pollito pio was realeased 12 years ago?
87: he is actually right at 17:17. if you speed up that song to 1.25x and slow the other one down to .75x the beats sound really similar
88: apored hater gehen international das darf die red army nicht zulassen
89: &quot;ok, ok, we hear you.. we will take the ratio into account now!&quot;&quot;stupid randoms.. the list not even change that much lol&quot;the entire list changes, half the videos aren&#39;t there anymore and the rest got all sorted out
90: this list is just bitter teen boys in the 2010s downvoting everything girls like
91: ??? there are so many bangers in here wtf do you mean most disliked songs???
92: cringe
93: 2:01 the like got disliked
94: who the hell hate twinkle star mf
95: the dislikes &quot;metric&quot; for this is a bit misleading. popular songs get a ton of likes and proportional amount of dislikes (usually 10%), so if a song is really big it would also garner a lot of dislikes even though most people like the songs. even normal youtube videos&#39; like/dislike ratios are like that most of the time.
96: this just shows we always hating on new stuff for no reason. cuz atleast half of these songs we can collectively agree on they are not bad at all.
97: no despasito !? this shiet is fake wth man !!
98: bro the dude who made this compilation is legit stupid. only displaying the dislikes but not the vies/ likes and ratios/ percentages speaks huge volumes about the copetence of that guy
99: 63 wtffffffffffffff
100: lil jon you cappin

117: macht meinermeinung nach kein sinn bei 17:40 das ein 12 jahre alter song von einem 2 jahre alten song den beat kopiert?!? ü§î
118: i know almost 40% of the songs on the list soly because of &quot;weird al&quot; yankovich
119: 100xcopyright strike lmao.

121: 7:02 is used for gta v life thug clips who rememebers hahaha , idk for me 12:53 the see you agein is sad , man rip paul
122: justin bieber was also something we called cringe when he was younger, but now it&#39;s really nostalgic and i&#39;m the biggest fan alive hahaha. also to all the other songs (almost), they&#39;re so good, they can&#39;t be hated.
123: 12:41 i get the rest of the songs being a bit bad or downright terible, but this, this is diabolical
124: 4:40 is just every gojo vs sukuna edit
125: nicki minaj and justin biber sucks as always but taylor swift&#39;s songs aren&#39;t that bad actually. also who the fck is rebecca black

130: crazy how most of the song is my favs.
131: 7:58 i wonder why its the most replayed üôèüò≠
132: some of these have genuinely bad or annoying production choices and then the rest are just... popular
133: 7 rings from ariana grande is from enter the gungeon (the soundboard)
134: how come you like one direction but not a fan of backstreet boys?
135: what i&#39;m surprised about is that there is no despacito in this mfking listedit: oh fk iits 8 years ago
136: lmao u see his heart rate go up when he talks about arianna grande. bro loves that girl
137: 8:20 just because shit is popular does not make it good... they get played on radio which 90% of the &quot;playerbase&quot; has to listen to during work because either headphones or earplugs are prohibited (causing massive dislike numbers because most of these songs are shit)
138: why the fuck is baile de favela dislike üò≠

147: bro you are more famous than real ohnepixel
148: caramba

171: bro not the reaction obviously but this video is so biased or like ohne said it&#39;s like that 1% out of so many likes that it&#39;s one of the most disliked but there are just sooo many bangers or songs that are not that bad and some are indeed bad even few justin bieber songs aren&#39;t that bad too.
172: mto engra√ßado ser br e se deparar com mc binladen, baile de favela, maisa cantando e anitta kkkkkkkkkkkkkk

265: the hills is a hated song wtf?
266: let us be honest. all this hate to bieber came just from jealous guys who never had hundreds of millions of girls going wet just looking at their picture or hearing their voice. bieber lived their dream. objectively looked, bieber was a very good looking guy and good singer and his songs also were a quality production (i mean technically good, but also catchy). same goes for many boybands. backstreet boys was loved by girls and hated by men. take that, same story. and so on. men called them f*gs and pussies etc. but simple thing is that they were just good looking, good singing and extremely popular ....yeah sure, of course i would very much like the same kind of attention from beautiful girls they get. but that does not mean that i start to lie about their musical and artistical quality ....where the hate to miley cyrus comes from i do not know. she is an amazing singer and superbeautiful incredibly sexy woman .....
267: bapwap from bibis beauty palace would be the 2nd most disliked song but its only 7 years old üíÄ

391: but i think many ppl hated just to hate and cus it was everywhere. like that song ‚Äúapeatu‚Äù or smth. forgot the name. but i hate it. like hate hate. but i think its only cus its everywhere, so by time it gets super annoying.i remember like 8-10 years ago everyone either loved or hated on justin bieber. and he was always main topic when someone talked about music ;-; i dont have anything against him tho. im just not fan of his music. im more to heavy metalüòÖ

401: how despacito is not in this lol?
402: the reason we hated jb as a kid is hilarious now. baby is a banger tho. it&#39;s in my palylist back then
403: justin bieber songs were like the early and end were good but the middle phase of his career is nah for me
404: poeple really do be hating twinkle twinkle little star

409: you hating superbass is racist
410: this is the worst top 100 ever made
411: rebecca black and justin bieber fighting for the number 1 spot
412: im in luve with da coco
413: the reason a lot of songs are here is because they are either extremely popular, overplayed, genuinely bad songs, or just something females enjoy.
414: one direction is straight heat and anyone who hates is still on a 10 year old bandwagon
415: they should of actually put songs that were hated and not just disliked on youtube , i can say this, the hills and a hand full of other songs being on there, shows no real effort was put into this. but hey, easy content for the raw channel hehe
416: 1:10 meudeus vey o &quot;pega a metralhadora&quot; eu vejo como rel√≠quia üò≠üò≠

421: i used to hate justin bieber back then before i learn to make music myself. but now his music is why he is famous. he make really good song. his live performance is crazy good. much respect
422: we used to hate jb and one direction just because we were jealous and envy them for their famous and all girls love them, but few years after i started love them and listening to their songs and i wished many times one direction back together again
423: 8:06 - 8:10/11 yep! o7
424: jb always treated his fans like dog shit, the hate he had &amp; has is deserved
425: how can you hate twinkle twinkle little star üò≠üò≠
426: i only realize now how absolutely sickening the hate against justin bieber was. he was just a kid trying to make a name for himself. boys hated him because girls crushed on him, and everyone else was just jealous because he was young and successful doing pop music. he was a child. even tho i was never a fan, it was hard watching people sh*t on him like that
427: the disrespect to pollito pio
428: i like super bass xdd
429: justin bieber was and is fine i don&#39;t understand the hate lmao
430: how was despacito not there
431: well rebecca black has an unfortunate story. she got harassed so much as a kid for the friday song it‚Äôs insane. people calling her, death threats, lost her friends and got bullied. just for that song lol. it‚Äôs badly produced sure but it‚Äôs not like it was a serious, just teens making dumb song.
432: no rickroll?
433: ‚Äúif you know, you know‚Äù üó£Ô∏èüî•

437: karma jojo siwa
438: love how this includes justin bieber&#39;s entire discography lmao
439: wait el pollito pio was way before that song 18:06
440: 18:10 üòÇüòÇüòÇ nah this not it
441: where was baby shark?üíÄ
442: his heart rate increases to a lullaby lol 4:57 , some bad memory ?! :d
443: i think he needs to learn the difference in samples, interpolation, remakes, covers, etc...there is also different kind of samples. :&quot;d
444: justic beiber got bullied
445: i did like justine&#39;s and one direction&#39;s songs back in the days even though most people said they were trash. i find songs by them in that era were much better than the ones they produced later which, nobody seems to hate.
446: Á¨ëÈº†
447: 18:00 u trippin bro, that spanish song was realesed way long before vegas
448: i never hated justin bieber for his music. i just have an absolutely massive hatred for his personality and the way he treated his fans. don&#39;t know how he is now, but the damage is done in my book.
449: can you do more music compilation video reactions. the ‚Äòmedia ranker‚Äô channel has some great ones üëç
450: wo ist wap bap von bibi mit 3,6 millionen dislikes???
451: justin bieber is the best wtf...
452: 16:05 because everyone used to hate on one direction and justin bieber just for the sake of it, including myself - now that we&#39;re 10-15 years older we can just see the songs as songs without the peer pressure of &quot;it sucks&quot;
453: 8 years old, he gotta do a newer vid of this
454: lol the world opinions are too toxic
455: judas disliked? the fuick
456: prime miley cirus or prime kim kardashian
457: the amount of times we saw justin bieber and nicki minaj on this list is just crazy üò≠
458: 100 copyright claims done üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
459: justin bieber was literally the goat of pop
460: this disslike list is older then wap bap.
461: justin&#39;s songs are soo good , the only reason people hated were because he had controversies in the past and we all know diddy was a part of justin&#39;s trauma.
462: i was expecting to see baby shark and despacito around top 10 but nah it didn&#39;t appear and also surprise to not see bts not even in top 100 wow
463: bro how does your heat go over 100 on a song video
464: justin bieber was just a kid‚Ä¶
465: get many dislike cause it sound bad xget many dislike cause have lot viewer ‚úì
466: people don&#39;t hate justin music because they him because of his fast growth in his career, always he is best üòé

471: nah nah nah 18:00 cmon you have to know you sound german you shouldve known and it is older
472: they didnt include another german youtube masterpiece which is &quot;wap bap&quot; by bibisbeautypalace sitting at 3.6 million dislikes
473: many songs are very good. i think the ratio between dislike and views makes an unfair chart
474: those are fine good old songs with lots of memories. nowadays pop songs are mostly similar vibe not very versatile
475: bannngaaa 1:21
476: 2:12 this dude from russia üòÇ he is freak for most people. i didn‚Äôt know that english channel will add this russian boy üòÇ

495: morgenshtern - –ø–æ—Å–æ—Å–∏ (official video 2020) 2.7 milenjoy
496:
497: calling the songs bad was due to the early to mid 2010&#39;s having great songs so the standard was higher to see similar quality songs nowadays is rare.
498: despacito didnt even make the list? its like the most popular song in youtube no shot it doesnt have more dislikes than jb
499: i think justin bieber is the reason why youtube hid the dislikes
500: wap bap :(
501: 18:00 he is confused because the same song got translated into german and was running on tv ads all the time lol.
502: 18:15 bro has lost it üò≠

507: some of these songs arent bad it just those people who doesnt have taste in music they probably listen to gang songs lmao
508: nicki ruins any song she&#39;s in
509: 24:20 like how can you hate this songi actually love it
510: el pollito pio is older than that tiktok song tho...
511: going by number of dislikes is stupid, there will always be more dislikes on a song that is more popular than another, it should be decided on a dislike to like ratio or a dislike to view ratio.
512: charlie poot! charlie poot!
513: this has both my favourite songs in it and the ones i hate the most
514: justin bieber single handedly owns most of the hated videos or smth

563: i was here in chat and he was asking for suggestions and i said most hated songs and this is one of the only times a streamer has ever reacted to something i&#39;ve put in chat
564: why is 7:55 the most replayedüò≠
565: 7rings balkan remix is the best
566: where is &quot;despacito&quot;?
567: so good ü§£ü§£
568: jb‚Äôs old songs are still not really my thing but his recent albums are actually good
569: was no one alive in 2012 in his chat bruh, howw does no one know the chick song
570: 7 rings this sounds like a typical cringe tiktok songhow can anyone like thisü§Æü§¢
571: 3 segundos de video e ja tiveram 2 musicas brasileiras. its over
572: i know that song of 7/11
573: wheres wap bap by bibi
574: 18:30 bro is onto nothing üòÇ
575: 14 years and justin bieber - baby is still the most disliked. i remember the dumbass flash games around justin bieber because how much everyone hated him ü§£ü§£
576: who is hating coco??
577: 4:58 the disappointment on his facefam
578: wonder what we seen more of justin bieber or miley cyrus lmfao
579: i got a feeling this video miscalculated by solely going off the quantity of dislikes rather than the proportion of likes to dislikes. no shit a song with 1m dislikes and 20m likes has more dislikes than a song with 200 dislikes and 100 likes. it&#39;s just that proportionally, a ratio of 1 : 20 is smaller than a ratio of 2 : 1.
580: lmao like 20% of these were young justins songs, thats crazy
581: whattt how is the hills by the weeknd hated ????
582: do most liked songs now

588: rebecca black sounds like a name for a pornstar but not a singer
589: 12:46 i love how pressed he was during the charlie puth&#39;s section.
590: i was expecting rick roll buy anyways
591: this video just unlocked core memories (el pollito pio and what does the fox say)
592: most of theese songs got disliked because they disliked the artist therefor made up their minds about their songs without probably listening to it.
593: 2:20 no goddamn way
594: crazy that the nae nae guy killed someone with an axe
595: jb carrying this listactually goated

599: 1:29 4:20 13:12 14:12 17:11 18:40
600: now it&#39;s almost impossible to hit 6 000 000 dislikes, because they are hidden, so people think they will do nothing. justin biber can be officially claimed as the most hated singer on the planet earth ever.
601: right title: ohnepixel reacts to justin bieber&#39;s most hated songs
602: gamnamstyle is perfect
603: 18:45 where to copy bro the chicken song is nearly 13 years old
604: chalii puut
605: i liked when he said, i used to have a crush on ariana.
606: (shitty song comes on)ohne: ohhhh its a banger
607: they are sorting it by most dislikes on video but in reality they should be sorting it according to the ratio of likes and dislikes
608: did bibi delete her song or was this before the song campe out? i could swear it had 2 million dislikes
609: government dislike coco
610: where is despacito
611: the audio files in the chat is crazy üíÄ
612: 12:46 bro i haven&#39;t even watched the movie, but i still know that its from fast and furious.
613: 8:26 that sh*t wild af üòÇü§£
614: idk what is it but bieber has some bangers fr
615: more view = more dislike no shit
616: many of the songs aren&#39;t bad, more like mediocre.it&#39;s just they were played so much every-fucking-where until you hate them.
617: most disliked songs: aka every jb&#39;s song from his teens and early 20s.
618: you can&#39;t hate on lady gaga

641: thick of it üòÇ
642: lmao this is just all the justin bieber song basically
643: i like how some of them just stun him into no commentary like 5:42 lmao
644: salio del madrid y no hizo nada porque no pudo sin florentino y sus goles en fuera de lugar
645: does he not understand the concept that a song that is very popular will have many dislikes (in total number) too? the video is about total dislikes, not like like/dislike ratio or smth. so ofcourse a song with 500 million views is gonna be on that list somewhere.
646: this video should be titled &quot; ohnepixel react to most disliked justin bieber and other artist&#39;s song &quot; tbh
647: how tf, bro loved all awfull musics lol
648: ngl ohne has some goated w takes

650: bruder wie zum geier hats der allererechte apo r e d da rein geschafft
651: 7:50 superhero tycoon ahh beat
652: and scream and shout and let it out
653: 90% of the songs are disliked for no reason tho lets be honest no ? :d
654: wab bap von bibi hatte doch auch 3 mio dislikes??
655: hating on &quot;let it go&quot; is a war crime
656: sometimes i can&#39;t tell if he&#39;s actually that goofy or just acting
657: i think they should make like dislikes to likes ratio like u know it has 10 times more dislikes than likes etc
658: nah, but the jump from 2.1m dislikes on 2nd vid to 6.2m on the 1st is hella crazy
659: rebecca black did a boiler room set xd
660: bro is a swiftie
661: ohnepixel is not fan of electronic music üò¢
662: no fucking way &quot;its everyday bro&quot; by jake paul is not in this at least top 10...
663: blud made nothing off of this video.
664: actually fun reaction, nice.

672: 12:43 bro really said transformers üíÄ
673: 12:41 this is why he doesn&#39;t sing
674: hes right its populare hate it should be rated by percentage wise
675: based pixel, everyone hates this song bcs its popular&gt; next song omg its so bad this song
676: i think they need to put a like/dislike ratio on the songs, and set a views filter like Ôºû1m views, so we can truly get which one is more hated instead of just putting random popular songs
677: no mika - relax take it easy.. pff fake list, 15 years or so ago, you walk the street and hear 6 different people blasting that stupid song from their phone in your radius.

684: party in the usa is a top tier song
685: ohnepixqc omegalul
686: looking back, i actually was a jb fan and liked &quot;baby&quot; a lot, probably had it in a playlist called &quot;best music&quot; or ill--egally downloaded the track because i liked it so much. ....impressive that the realest bunny apo r-e-d made it into a compilation like that. sad what fame does to a man... maybe in 10 years he can come back to germany after the statute of limitation has expired, for now he will chill in dubie, uae and istie, t√ºrkiye. sleeping in different apartments payed by others, promoting and advertising ponzis and pyramids, while his wife and children chill in germany on government b√ºrgie-basis.
