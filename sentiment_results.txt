4: 4: 9:06 sadly, that song was made low quality on purpose (parody/comedy music), but the people in that time didn&#39;t get the humor and tought it was made in serious. now colibritany an her music is an internet classic, my favorite one is &quot;mami silicon&quot; or &quot;silicon babe&quot; | Sentiment: negative

20: 20: since it&#39;s just saying &quot;most disliked&quot; it&#39;s just going off the raw amount, not the ratio. if every song had 99% likes, &quot;most disliked&quot; just means &quot;most viewed&quot;. ratio is what really matters. but popularity still matters since there&#39;d be plenty 100% disliked songs that have no views. so what these compilations should really be is &quot;most popular disliked songs&quot;. a.k.a &quot;most popular songs that are ratio&#39;d&quot;. (over 50% dislikes) a.k.a &quot;the most disliked songs, that are actually disliked&quot; (take your pick) | Sentiment: None

60: 60: it&#39;s crazy that he looks at all these pop stars with ghost writers and production teams who do everything for them (except sing) and shit like bieber who is literally just an industry plant and think any of it is at all good. it&#39;s all unoriginal trash. it&#39;s like loot boxes. they are fun because they are designed to target the parts of your monkey brain. no different than this over designed shitty pop music. | Sentiment: None

83: 83: i never really understand the hate with jb before (i was either too young to understand or just really don&#39;t see him as bad as they portray). anyways, it was before i saw a game in y8 website where you can drag a limpy body of bieber across the screen like hitting him on the walls. now that i have grown up, i realize that bieber was just as young and he went through too much media and audience hate. i feel really sad about thinking about it. | Sentiment: None
84: 84: warum englisch | Sentiment: negative
85: 85: i get the point why most of them are hated because played in public so many times that hearing that shit for one more time is became unbearable when you are totally fine to play in repeat the same song or playlist for 10 to 20 times, but when it gets played everyday - you just can&#39;t hear it. this isn&#39;t about playes or views, this is about reverse mainstream effect. | Sentiment: negative
86: 86: ok so how did &quot;el pollito pio&quot; copy &quot;vegas&quot; if vegas was released 3 years ago and el pollito pio was realeased 12 years ago? | Sentiment: positive

94: 94: who the hell hate twinkle star mf | Sentiment: negative
95: 95: the dislikes &quot;metric&quot; for this is a bit misleading. popular songs get a ton of likes and proportional amount of dislikes (usually 10%), so if a song is really big it would also garner a lot of dislikes even though most people like the songs. even normal youtube videos&#39; like/dislike ratios are like that most of the time. | Sentiment: None
96: 96: this just shows we always hating on new stuff for no reason. cuz atleast half of these songs we can collectively agree on they are not bad at all. | Sentiment: None

266: 266: let us be honest. all this hate to bieber came just from jealous guys who never had hundreds of millions of girls going wet just looking at their picture or hearing their voice. bieber lived their dream. objectively looked, bieber was a very good looking guy and good singer and his songs also were a quality production (i mean technically good, but also catchy). same goes for many boybands. backstreet boys was loved by girls and hated by men. take that, same story. and so on. men called them f*gs and pussies etc. but simple thing is that they were just good looking, good singing and extremely popular ....yeah sure, of course i would very much like the same kind of attention from beautiful girls they get. but that does not mean that i start to lie about their musical and artistical quality ....where the hate to miley cyrus comes from i do not know. she is an amazing singer and superbeautiful incredibly sexy woman ..... | Sentiment: positive
