3: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=386">6:26</a> I think we all did man.<br><br>so many of these are actually such iconic bangers though
4: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=546">9:06</a> Sadly, that song was made low quality on purpose (parody/comedy music), but the people in that time didn&#39;t get the humor and tought it was made in serious. Now Colibritany an her music is an internet classic, my favorite one is &quot;Mami silicon&quot; or  &quot;Silicon Babe&quot;
5: aka top 10 disliked justin bieber songs
6: Wehren is Wap Bap from Bibi
7: As a Spaniard, I must tell you that ‚ÄúPollito P√≠o‚Äù came out before ‚ÄúI wanna ride,‚Äù 12 years earlier to be exact.
8: This whole list is fake and BS none of the songs are the most disliked
9: Baby is still bad dude.
10: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=275">4:35</a> , he is right, its a banger &quot;untouchable, untouchableee&quot; but just that part, the rest of the song is ragebait
11: most songs are disliked because they have many views, but margin of like to dislike is hudge
12: The man who made the original video is definitely a Justin Bieber hater.
13: Dont fucking @ me... Justin Bieber got WAY better after he got away from the heart throb kid image that was forced on him. Love yourself, sorry, STAY, Ghost, Peaches etc... all BANGERS.
14: I got leafy flashbacks at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=510">8:30</a> LMAO
15: I hate all of them, I was definitely part of the dislikes
16: Justin Bieber really got better with age his newer stuff is brilliant
17: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=389">6:29</a> this thing is violating my ears üò≠
18: i will never get justin bieber hate<br><br>this dude is so talented and have so many great songs
19: bro just put the most known songs in the video and called them disliked?
20: Since it&#39;s just saying &quot;most disliked&quot; it&#39;s just going off the raw amount, not the ratio. If every song had 99% likes, &quot;most disliked&quot; just means &quot;most viewed&quot;. Ratio is what really matters. But popularity still matters since there&#39;d be plenty 100% disliked songs that have no views. So what these compilations should really be is &quot;most popular disliked songs&quot;. a.k.a &quot;most popular songs that are ratio&#39;d&quot;. (over 50% dislikes) a.k.a &quot;the most disliked songs, that are actually disliked&quot; (take your pick)
21: E

41: notice how there is no Beatles songs
42: Recking ball drama was about death of hanna montana and birth of new Miley I think
43: A little bit of brazilian referenze about music 97, the video doesn&#39;t cover the hate part xD, but basically there was a girl who sings very very badly, alongside this main singer, doing voice like a cattle boiling water xD that&#39;s why it was hated a lot back on the days
44: Bebar hater this guy who made this video
45: Idk about you but I remember hating on Justin Bieber so much back in around 4th grade. Turns out, his old songs are actually kinda bop and I now feel nostalgic listening to em.
46: Nicki Minaj‚Äôs ‚Äúsuper bass‚Äù isnt talking about bass, its talking about ‚Äúsuperb ass‚Äù. Like she got a phat ass.

56: Yea, all popular songs will have a LOT of dislikes, even if it&#39;s a beloved song. Being on this list doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything.
57: Banger <br>bangher
58: I came into this looking for thick of it
59: Where is Bibisbeautypalace with How it is?
60: It&#39;s crazy that he looks at all these pop stars with ghost writers and production teams who do everything for them (except sing) and shit like Bieber who is literally just an industry plant and think any of it is at all good. It&#39;s all unoriginal trash. It&#39;s like loot boxes. They are fun because they are designed to target the parts of your monkey brain. No different than this over designed shitty pop music.
61: Pollito pio is much more older than Vegas, Vegas was published on 2022 and Pollitio Pio on 2012
62: admita:<br>voc√™ n√£o esperava ver a ma√≠sa nesse v√≠deo

66: i cant believe this video made me realize 99% of justin biebers songs really werent that bad
67: The selfie song is the most shitty stuff human has ever created across all the entire human history

73: Ohnepixel&#39;s vibe makes any song better lol
74: iswtg pulcino pio is fire
75: Nicki minaj was hated bcuz the Videos controversial cuz she shakes butt right
76: SO WIE PHOTOSHOP
77: The message to take home is that &quot;more love comes with more hate&quot;
78: the justin beiber hate when I was young was forced. ngl
79: I love &quot;Call me maybe&quot; üò¢
80: Love how he keeps throwing in random german words lol
81: They should make most dislaked by ratio not total amount
82: everyone had a crush on ariana ohne
83: I never really understand the hate with JB before (I was either too young to understand or just really don&#39;t see him as bad as they portray). Anyways, it was before I saw a game in y8 website where you can drag a limpy body of Bieber across the screen like hitting him on the walls. Now that I have grown up, I realize that Bieber was just as young and he went through too much media and audience hate. I feel really sad about thinking about it.
84: warum englisch
85: I get the point why most of them are hated because played in public so many times that hearing that shit for one more time is became unbearable when you are totally fine to play in repeat the same song or playlist for 10 to 20 times, but when it gets played everyday - you just can&#39;t hear it. This isn&#39;t about playes or views, this is about reverse mainstream effect.
86: ok so how did &quot;El Pollito Pio&quot; copy &quot;Vegas&quot; if vegas was released 3 years ago and El Pollito Pio was realeased 12 years ago?
87: he is actually right at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=1037">17:17</a>. if you speed up that song to 1.25x and slow the other one down to .75x the beats sound really similar
88: Apored hater gehen international das darf die RED army nicht zulassen
89: &quot;Ok, OK, we hear you.. We will take the ratio into account now!&quot;<br>&quot;Stupid randoms.. the list not even change that much lol&quot;<br><b>The entire list changes, half the videos aren&#39;t there anymore and the rest got all sorted out</b>
90: This list is just bitter teen boys in the 2010s downvoting everything girls like
91: ??? there are so many bangers in here wtf do you mean most disliked songs???
92: Cringe
93: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=121">2:01</a> the like got disliked
94: Who the hell hate twinkle star mf
95: The dislikes &quot;metric&quot; for this is a bit misleading. Popular songs get a ton of likes and proportional amount of dislikes (usually 10%), so if a song is really big it would also garner a lot of dislikes even though most people like the songs. Even normal youtube videos&#39; like/dislike ratios are like that most of the time.
96: This just shows we always hating on new stuff for no reason. Cuz atleast half of these songs we can collectively agree on they are not bad at all.
97: NO DESPASITO !? THIS SHIET IS FAKE  WTH MAN !!
98: bro the dude who made this compilation is legit stupid. only displaying the dislikes but not the vies/ likes and ratios/ percentages speaks huge volumes about the copetence of that guy
99: 63 wtffffffffffffff
100: lil jon you cappin

114: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=459">7:39</a> warum hast du eine bastighg stream liste
115: I can&#39;t believe almost all of JB&#39;s song are in here üòÇ
116: Its actually so insane that Apored made the list three times.
117: Macht meinermeinung nach kein Sinn bei <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=1060">17:40</a> das ein 12 Jahre alter Song von einem 2 Jahre alten Song den Beat Kopiert?!? ü§î
118: i know almost 40% of the songs on the list SOLY BECAUSE OF &quot;WEIRD AL&quot; YANKOVICH
119: 100XCopyright strike lmao.
120: Bro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=580">9:40</a> has me dead WHY DID HE GET SO MAD

122: justin bieber was also something we called cringe when he was younger, but now it&#39;s really nostalgic and i&#39;m the biggest fan alive hahaha. Also to all the other songs (almost), they&#39;re so good, they can&#39;t be hated.
123: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=761">12:41</a>  i get the rest of the songs being a bit bad or downright terible, but this, this is diabolical
124: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=280">4:40</a> is just every gojo vs sukuna edit
125: Nicki minaj and Justin biber sucks as always but taylor Swift&#39;s songs aren&#39;t that bad actually. Also who the fck is Rebecca black

132: some of these have genuinely bad or annoying production choices and then the rest are just... popular
133: 7 rings from ariana grande is from enter the gungeon (the soundboard)
134: how come you like One direction but not a fan of Backstreet boys?
135: What i&#39;m surprised about is that there is no despacito in this mfking list<br><br>EDIT: Oh fk iits 8 years ago
136: Lmao u see his heart rate go up when he talks about Arianna Grande. Bro loves that girl
137: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=500">8:20</a> just because shit is popular does not make it good... they get played on radio which 90% of the &quot;playerbase&quot; has to listen to during work because either headphones or earplugs are prohibited (causing massive dislike numbers because most of these songs are shit)
138: Why the fuck is Baile de favela dislike üò≠

171: bro not the reaction obviously but this video is so biased or like ohne said it&#39;s like that 1% out of so many likes that it&#39;s one of the most disliked but there are just sooo many bangers or songs that are not that bad and some are indeed bad even few justin bieber songs aren&#39;t that bad too.

180: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=451">7:31</a> bro i so agree, but in secret tho
181: all these songs fall into one or multiple of these categories:<br><br>people who have done shit that&#39;s questionable, controversial or despicable <br>shit or thirst choreography with intentional camera angles<br>repetitive lyrics<br>outfit choice, or lack of<br>songs that are just hated by all adults but adored by all kids<br>songs with shit lyrics, lack of choreography and an over used melody, but just works<br>got famous after mum uploaded a song on YouTube<br>disliked because woke viewer<br><br>my thoughts<br><br>who the fuck is Rebecca Black, i cant stand Bieber either, and Nicki Minaj is the thirstiest of them all

265: The hills is a hated song wtf?
266: Let us be honest. All this hate to Bieber came just from jealous guys who never had hundreds of millions of girls going wet just looking at their picture or hearing their voice. Bieber lived their dream. Objectively looked, Bieber was a very good looking guy and good singer and his songs also were a quality production (I mean technically good, but also catchy). Same goes for many boybands. BackStreet Boys was loved by girls and hated by men. Take That, same story. And so on. Men called them f*gs and pussies etc. But simple thing is that they were just good looking, good singing and extremely popular ....<br><br>Yeah sure, of course I would very much like the same kind of attention from beautiful girls they get. But that does not mean that I start to lie about their musical and artistical quality ....<br><br>Where the hate to Miley Cyrus comes from I do not know. She is an amazing singer and superbeautiful incredibly sexy woman .....

379: The thing about Justin Bieber is that he has only 3 good songs:<br>What do you mean<br>Boyfriend<br>Love yourself
380: 2nd spot shouldve been BibisBeautyPalace&#39;s &quot;How it is&quot; with 3.6 mil dislikes...<br><br>nvm this video is a year older than the song.
381: Half of the list is actually bangers...its insane.

402: The reason we hated JB as a kid is hilarious now. Baby is a banger tho. It&#39;s in my palylist back then

408: Baby has 16 million dislike the guy is high
409: YOU HATING SUPERBASS IS RACIST
410: this is the worst top 100 ever made
411: Rebecca black and justin bieber fighting for the Number 1 spot
412: IM IN LUVE WITH DA COCO
413: The reason a lot of songs are here is because they are either extremely popular, overplayed, genuinely bad songs, or just something females enjoy.
414: one direction is straight heat and anyone who hates is still on a 10 year old bandwagon
415: they should of actually put songs that were hated and not just disliked on youtube , i can say this, The hills and a hand full of other songs being on there, shows no real effort was put into this. But hey, easy content for the raw channel hehe
416: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=70">1:10</a> meudeus vey o &quot;pega a metralhadora&quot; eu vejo como rel√≠quia üò≠üò≠

421: I used to hate justin bieber back then before i learn to make music myself. But now his music is why he is famous. He make really good song. His live performance is crazy good. Much respect
422: We used to hate JB and One direction just because we were jealous and envy them for their famous and all girls love them, but few years after i started love them and listening to their songs and i wished many times One direction back together again
423: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=486">8:06</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=490">8:10</a>/11 yep! o7
424: JB always treated his fans like dog shit, the hate he had &amp; has is deserved
425: HOW CAN YOU HATE TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR üò≠üò≠
426: i only realize now how absolutely sickening the hate against justin bieber was. he was just a kid trying to make a name for himself. boys hated him because girls crushed on him, and everyone else was just jealous because he was young and successful doing pop music. HE WAS A CHILD. even tho i was never a fan, it was hard watching people sh*t on him like that
427: The disrespect to Pollito pio
428: I like super bass XDD
429: Justin Bieber was and is fine I don&#39;t understand the hate lmao
430: How was despacito not there
431: Well Rebecca black has an unfortunate story. She got harassed so much as a kid for the Friday song it‚Äôs insane. People calling her, death threats, lost her friends and got bullied. Just for that song lol. It‚Äôs badly produced sure but it‚Äôs not like it was a serious, just teens making dumb song.
432: No rickroll?
433: ‚ÄúIf you know, you know‚Äù üó£Ô∏èüî•
434: I donno why most of these are hated. These are common contents of playlist of people around me on these song&#39;s times.
435: where&#39;s thick of it?

444: justic beiber got bullied
445: I did like Justine&#39;s and One direction&#39;s songs back in the days even though most people said they were trash. I find songs by them in that era were much better than the ones they produced later which, nobody seems to hate.

497: Calling the songs bad was due to the early to mid 2010&#39;s having great songs so the standard was higher to see similar quality songs nowadays is rare.

579: I got a feeling this video miscalculated by solely going off the quantity of dislikes rather than the proportion of likes to dislikes. No shit a song with 1m dislikes and 20m likes has more dislikes than a song with 200 dislikes and 100 likes. It&#39;s just that proportionally, a ratio of 1 : 20 is smaller than a ratio of 2 : 1.

645: does he not understand the concept that a song that is very popular will have many dislikes (in total number) too? The video is about total dislikes, not like like/dislike ratio or smth. So ofcourse a song with 500 million views is gonna be on that list somewhere.
646: this video should be titled &quot; ohnepixel react to most disliked justin bieber and other artist&#39;s song &quot; tbh
647: how tf, bro loved all awfull musics lol
648: Ngl Ohne has some goated W takes
649: They need to update this KSI has 2.2m dislikes

652: And scream and shout and let it out
653: 90% of the songs are disliked for no reason tho lets be honest no ? :D
654: Wab bap von Bibi hatte doch auch 3 Mio dislikes??
655: hating on &quot;let it go&quot; is a war crime
656: Sometimes I can&#39;t tell if he&#39;s actually that goofy or just acting
657: I think they should make like dislikes to likes ratio like u know  it has 10 times more dislikes than likes etc
658: Nah, but the jump from 2.1m dislikes on 2nd vid to 6.2m on the 1st is hella crazy
659: Rebecca Black did a Boiler Room Set xD
660: bro is a swiftie
661: Ohnepixel is not fan of electronic music üò¢
662: no fucking way &quot;its everyday bro&quot; by jake paul is not in this at least top 10...
663: Blud made nothing off of this video.
664: actually fun reaction, nice.
665: No way he made the Transformers joke again üòÇ
666: &#39;&#39;of all time&#39;&#39;<br>8 years ago
667: i remember parodies of these songs more than the original songs lol
668: justin is like half of these songsüíÄ
669: looking back on it, crazy how the whole world hated bieber so much they portrayed him to die in different movies and shows when he was just a kid
670: that so good... So GOOD... So YOO.. at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=483">8:03</a>
671: this vid reminds me some good song i heard before, that&#39;s nice‚ù§
672: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=763">12:43</a> bro really said transformers üíÄ
673: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=761">12:41</a> this is why he doesn&#39;t sing
674: hes right its populare hate it should be rated by percentage wise
675: based pixel, everyone hates this song bcs its popular&gt; next song omg its so bad this song
676: i think they need to put a like/dislike ratio on the songs, and set a views filter like Ôºû1M views, so we can truly get which one is more hated instead of just putting random popular songs
677: no mika - relax take it easy.. pff fake list, 15 years or so ago, you walk the street and hear 6 different people blasting that stupid song from their phone in your radius.
678: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inye4-009xQ&amp;t=73">1:13</a> o carnaval desse ano foi daora

684: party in the usa is a top tier song
685: OhnepiXQC omegalul
686: Looking back, I actually was a JB fan and liked &quot;Baby&quot; a lot, probably had it in a playlist called &quot;best music&quot; or ill--egally downloaded the track because I liked it so much. <br><br><br>....<br>Impressive that the REALest bunny Apo R-E-D made it into a compilation like that. Sad what fame does to a man... maybe in 10 years he can come back to Germany after the statute of limitation has expired, for now he will chill in Dubie, UAE and Istie, T√ºrkiye. Sleeping in different apartments payed by others, promoting and advertising ponzis and pyramids,  while his wife and children chill in Germany on Government B√ºrgie-Basis.
687: Shakira never misses‚Ä¶ tik tok on the clock?
