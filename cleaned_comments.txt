18: their best songs come from some of the most complex emotions, and tempered by cultural norms and expectations. it was truly unleashed with vocaloids, where anyone with a computer can express themselves through songs that cover everything from love and loss to madness and isolation, as well as mundane things like your pudding dying (爆砕プリン) or last-minute assignments, virtually anonymously,

92: ppapクソワロタwwwwwww

96: lessgo yoru ni kakeru and odo and lemon and many others ha
97: love ado💙 one of my favoriteslove the rest too❤
98: you should watch the music video of number 88. its titled niji (rainbow). its about life after marriage. and also its a doraemon movie theme song where nobita and shizuka got married.
99: ppap is the best song ever. btw, that troll song singer is actually a comedian. he had series of these and well know in asia for his non-sequitur humor. (it&#39;s not monty python... but more like a subdue benny hill)
100: should prob point out these songs are top due to anime (for the most part).it is not only japanese people listening to these, but just anime fans in general, so quite frankly it is probably a large amount of these streams being western.
101: 20:44 natori mentioned!?!!!🔥🔥🔥 natori for the president

111: kizaru 💀💀💀
112: i am japanese. i use a translator to make comments. i&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s a strange sentence.🤖💦&quot;lemon&quot; is the theme song of the drama, a song that sings painfully about the sadness and loss of a loved one, and became popular because yonezu&#39;s own family&#39;s death had a significant impact on the production and many people sympathized with the lyrics.i&#39;m glad you seem to be having a good time! thank you for listening to japanese songs.🥳💖

123: some wild ones on here. not bad, but like just okay at absolute best.
124: no mukanjyo, no avid, no spark again, its so sad
125: ok

131: need more
132: ppap最高
133: kenshi was suffering from depression, but writing song is like his light, like life gives you lemons.
134: tbh, i prefer kenshi yonezu&#39;s orion waaaaaaay more than lemon...
135: 14:40 nostalgia 🔥
136: 91, reminds me of that one ratatatat doujin :(

149: back number goat
150: yoasobi supremacy
151: nick we all love you, our fave pre watcher
152: i want that reaction to top 100 american songs you did at the end lmao
153: 7:29 he dropped an album recently. it&#39;s called &#39;under blue&#39;
154: bad songs
155: nick should do a reaction to pen pineapple apple pen. it&#39;s a classic
156: didn&#39;t oda confirm that he based kizaru on the ppap guy?
157: yes, u gotta hear baby metal x bmth
158: nicholas, i have a favor to ask you. please watch the live video of sakanaction&#39;s song &quot;music.&quot; the pleasure will send you to heaven.
159: ohhh prx vs heretic early
160: nico-niki, you really seem to know almost every song!! impressive! appreciate you showing love for japanese music!!
161: the fact that ado has gotten so popular so fast is insane ngl, i swear i didn&#39;t hear about ado until like two years ago and now looking at the list, its insane how popular she gotten, maybe i was just living under a rock but like, i felt like she gotten really popular really fast.
162: i like when you say wtf in 9.47 without sound...you don&#39;t even wanna disturb the good song....always love your reaction thought.....
163: ニコラスニキのリアクション動画マジで好きすぎて見てるとこっちまで楽しくなる！bump of chickenとかも聴いて欲しい！
164: i watch from 100 to 34 and wonder why not any of lisa , yellow monkey or even larc en ciel in here ...
165: &quot;no wonder it&#39;s 69&quot; got me dude
166: nicholas, you should react tuki. 『騙シ愛』
167: back number is fucking good
168: bro 30:17 is literally at this point 😭😭💀💀💀
169: ppap lol
170: it&#39;s the most forced reaction i&#39;ve ever seen ☠️
171: watching the stupid anime watchers weebs in the chat mad is my favorite part
172: i cant belive tuki bansanka isnt here.... t-t
173: pretender by official higedandism is one of my favorites, i&#39;m glad it&#39;s on #6
174: taishō sugō aka masaki suda played the very smart yet confined phillip in kamen rider double/ w. he was the wizard in the shazam movie although he overdubbed lines translating into japanese.
175: if you’re heading back to japan, there’s a massive warning about foreigners. thanks to some not so great youtubers that are disrespecting and disrupting everyone, some places are banning people of non-japanese descent. the japanese people are very meek and don’t fight back leading to people taking advantage of them. it’s also lead to a massive drop in japanese learning english. i know new york city has a japanese language program because i saw signs for it last time i was there basically they teach you japanese language.
176: you do realize that no musical artist makes any money in japan at all. they get a portion of cd or e-sales but they barely actually earn anything. everyone does a standard 9 to 5 to make ends meet. artists only play for the love of music. it’s actually stated in the contracts they signed. it’s such a waste of labor. actors are also paid a certain amount which is why they have to do multiple acting jobs to earn a decent wage. they might do a live shot monday then go to a voice acting session tuesday then back again to live back to another voice gig or commercial shoot. it just keeps going through the week. most music artists in japan retire by age 35 because they can’t keep up with the wage issues. actors usually retire around age 45. it’s just a vicious cycle.
177: i didn’t realise how big hige dandism is but ofc cos they only make bangers
178: 32:43 &quot;depression pop&quot; 😂
179: i loved when da pump when they made the song called &quot;if&quot;.so much nostalgic song is in this list and im happi.its not like best its most watched so its not only japan, people from other countries watches them too dont forget that.
180: 7:41 my dad gym song that i added (he&#39;s japanese)
181: evangelion op was defeated by &quot;you are my special&quot;, how the hell did this happen?
182: japanese top 100 destroys all world top lists
183: lol htf is pineapple pen number 5?? how??!! well sad that none of the newer bleach songs were up there but at least there were a couple older ones lol.
184: 29:49 kizaru jumpscare
185: me seeing rokudenashi in the list. i&#39;m happy
186: how is ponponpon not on the top played list
187: so i kept track of all the yoasobi and ado songs. yoasobi had 9 songs (2 of them were #3 and #2). ado had 6 songs in this whole list. i kept track of these two cause i like them the most of all the jp artists
188: i think the songs that brother nicholas likes tend to have high-pitched parts, and it seems like high vocals are popular in japan too. but in this ranking, there were so many songs where it felt like, “ah, there’s a high note coming right after this part!” but then it didn’t quite get there—such a missed opportunity 😅i wish they’d show more love for japan.
189: i expected the whole of twice&#39;s japanese discography to be here lol.. ig maybe because they&#39;re not a japanese group
190: your face at the number 5, i pied myself ^^
191: ppap by kizaru 😂
192: japan bros you have some great fucking taste.also, ppap was a crazy curveball 🤣
193: i like that in japan musicians often use instrumentals and are not afraid to play with their voices. it also seems that japan has the kindest and most positive music.
194: is it more biased? considering he didn’t like the others much unless it was mostly anime, or maybe he just likes mostly soft spoken songs?
195: wooo proud japanese/american moment for me. glad you enjoy our stuff (minus ppap lol)
196: nah.. you dont even know what we do to take over ppap from the top..you dont even know fruit wars
197: ニコラスよ。日本のネットミームも見る気は無いのか？日本の裏の顔「変態」を楽しめるよ
198: just a tad happy here that yorushika had a couple on the list. you gotta check out their music!
199: first loveが出た時にspotifyやyoutubeがあって今のレベルで見る人いたら数百億再生は余裕でいってる。日本だけでcd 860万枚だからね。
200: lemon intro slaps ngl
201: 30:30 ピコ太郎無双
202: wait, there is no bansanka by tuki on that list?
203: anybody knows the title song no 23?
204: never heard the version of #19. only know ado&#39;s cover
205: ppap the best song ever 🔥
206: love your jpop reaction!
207: synth vibing 2025 - just released (new electronica / edm album) ==righteous destruction (rock / metal album)castlevania: aura of holy might (soundtrack / remix album)
208: j-song are really unique, i&#39;ve now listened to like 5717 jsongs on list and probably 90% of them already on my listbelieve me..even the small artist have really good songs and voice too
209: i&#39;m a japanese teacher and i seriously want to teach you japanese. you have a high level of comprehension, so i&#39;m sure your interpretation would be amazing if you learned japanese.
210: pen-pineapple-apple-pen xd
211: 18:52表情がサイコパス過ぎだろw
212:
213: ubi
214: looking forward to baby metal reaction. plese do it quickly
215: the fact that you know 90% of the songs and to think this all started when you did that blind reaction to anime openings. lol
216: ppapで黄猿言われてんのバカ笑ったｗｗ確かにめっちゃ似てるｗｗ
217: ambatuakm
218: you should check the top 230 anisong cd single sales from 1990 to 2024
219: number 77 is the same people who did the mha vigilante op
220: 73位のyoasobiの時の反応😂楽しいビデオをありがとう😊✨日本から見てます🇯🇵🗾私もたくさん良い音楽を聴くぞー😆⸜( * ॑˘ ॑* )⸝⋆*ʓ ꩢ ʓ ꩢ
221: 33:38 “lemon” is a song produced in 2020 as the theme for a television drama. the lyrics beautifully reflect the drama’s themes, and together with the show’s popularity, the song attracted significant attention. it also served as the breakthrough that brought the artist kenshi yonezu into the public spotlight.
222: 30:17 “pen-pineapple-apple-pen” is a song written and performed by the japanese comedian pikotaro. its surreal humor made it a hit in 2016, and it later became a sensation in the united states as well.
223: 10:22 masaki suda（菅田将暉） is a famous actor in japan, and he’s also a talented singer.
224: ok, official hige dandism gotten huuuge since i first heard them.

227: ppapほんま草
228: 3:30 reiner🗣️🔥 reiner🗣️🔥 reiner🗣️🔥
229: when kenshi yonezu released lemon, i felt the need as a japanese to sing it in the middle of a pubg hotspot, and i did. i performed it in front of a downed enemy, no one came to interrupt me, and he bled to death right in front of me.
230: hi! i love your channel, especially about ado.by the way, could you react japanese song &#39;tentai kansoku’ by japanese band &#39;bump of chicken’.it was released 24 years ago and it became the 2000&#39;s national representative song.i have never seen the japanese dislike the song.i am very interested in your thoughts, since it is not complicated but purely touchs the hearts of japanese people. you in advance!
231: recent songs are getting more views from overseas since anime culture has become more popular last few years.
232: i was not expecting hai yorokonde to be on here. i&#39;ve been bumping that shit for months after spotify added it to my queue. i had no clue it was that big lol
233: 7:19 finally eve 😭
234: lemon&quot; is the name of the drama.it became very popular.

243: nicholas please react this one too, this is a good list of japan music
244: 今日本で最も人気なミセス。海外だとインフェルノしか聴かれてなさそうよなぁ。
245: it&#39;s about time you started calling yourself japanese. i&#39;m japanese, so you should be proud.
246: i didn’t like specialz at first neither, but this year, for some reason, it’s been playing on repeat for days in my head and playlist 🤷🏾‍♀️
247: man with a mission is not on the list?! 😮
248: ピコ太郎5位はまぁ…仕方ないwwww
249: lemon release for tv series called unnatural, that series so fckind good tho
250: everything except pinapple pear and the tokyo drift song was amazing! 😅
251: 私は日本の米津玄師さんのファンです。私が言うのもなんですが、このランキングに出てくる米津玄師さんの歌う曲は、全て米津玄師さん自身が作詞作曲をして歌い、ディスコグラフィのジャケット絵も描いています。さらに、菅田将暉さんの歌う「まちがいさがし」、daokoさんと共に歌う「打上花火」の作詞作曲も米津玄師さんが行っています。僕は米津玄師さんは努力と才能の神だと思ってます。
252: ヨルシカのリアクションお願いします！
253: ピコ太郎のspotify過疎ってて草
254: ただローマ字版の歌詞を見つけて歌う練習をしなさい。そのうち歌えるようになります。私もそれで日本語を習得しています。頑張ってね。

257: 黄猿コメでクソ笑ってんの好き
258: i am hoping to be reborn in my next life as a japanese boy hahaha
259: eve my goat
260: this is unofficial no? there are tons of artists that wasn&#39;t on the list.
261: yosobi fucking carried
262: 29:46 壊れたwww
263: so fun fact about ppap song, that song was the most viewed j-song for awhile 😂 i watch 1 channel breakdown month by month how much view every song get and the community in that channel so pump up surpassing that meme song lol😂😂
264: i&#39;ve watched and listened to anime/japanese music since i was a kid in the 90&#39;s and i don&#39;t think i recognized many of the songs on this list at all lol except for a few obvious ones on demon slayer, jjk, naruto. i think i must just have terrible taste in music lol the japanese band i&#39;ve probably listened to the most was introduced to me like 15-16 years ago called &quot;mass of fermenting dregs&quot; but besides that it&#39;s like 80% city pop music which i thought would be more popular than it actually is too.
265: i see you didnt know what number 69 was. its called &quot;yesterday&quot; and its from a very underrated anime movie called &quot;hello world&quot;.
266: most artists appearances: top 61st yoasobi - 9 songs2nd kenshi - 8 songs- 2nd hige dandism - 8 songs3rd ado - 6 songs4th mrs green apple - 4 songs - 4th back number - 4 songsthese 6 artists make up 39% of the entire top 100 list!edit: also, kenshi does appear as a feature on another song, so you could say he had 9 songs, but i felt like features don’t really count so i didn’t include it!
267: racing into the night by yoasobi is number 2 on this list despite being shadow banned on yt due to self harming themes. maybe that is why the copyrite on that song is very lax.
268: my boy kizaru was spitting 🍎🖊🍍🖊😎 👔👉✨ 🍎🖊🍍🖊👖👞👞

299: for u to understand why lemon is such a good song u hv to understand the lyrics and the reason why kenshi wrote tht song. also its a song for a japanese drama called unnatural and its really good you should give it a try.
300: 這些歌曲大部分都非常好聽！該把它們放進音樂清單裡面了！
301: i&#39;m so sad there was no sheena ringo :(
302: something i like about japan&#39;s top 100 compared to the western world. their music and taste isn&#39;t formulaic. if you were going through a western top 100, you&#39;d already hear about 10 songs that sound the like they used the same footnotes, same melodies etc. here we have a list of ppl just listening to whatever tf they want and you&#39;re seeing the variety reflected on the list. every entry is a completely different vibe than the last.
303: overreact
304: 06:06 yes! please do babymetal! they&#39;re crazy good, especially in live performances
305: one of my favorite japanese songs is &quot; come my way&quot; it was the outro song for season 7 inuyasha

307: masaki suda and creepy nuts have released a collaborative song called &quot;soundtrack&quot; as part of a radio station project. similarly, creepy nuts and yoasobi have released a collaborative song called &quot;baka majime.&quot; please give it a listen.
308: もはや日本人で作ったランキングではないけどな。海外人気を掴めた曲達ばかり。
309: yonezu kenshi is king of jpop
310: pineapple apple, lemon, what fruits next? lychee?😂
311: nicholas, we are waiting for you! from japan.
312: why spyair not in top 10... why????!!!!
313: 29:48 ppap
314: back number mention!
315: nah bro even if you didn&#39;t know japanese back in the day translator used to put subtitles and the jaoanese lyrics with our alphabet so you could sing along
316: brooo why aren&#39;t there any asian kung fu generation in this list

321: i recommend youfrom jpjapanese brand-new idol shit
322: no shiawase - back number is crazy..that literally the best song 😂
323: lemonが人気なのは日本語の歌詞と、テーマソングになったドラマの完成度です。netflixにあるので、ぜひ「アンナチュラル」を観てほしいです。日本をよりリアルに苦い視点で知ることができます
324: i don&#39;t know which one to put where, they were all in my playlist already this whole freaking time.am i japanese then? and thats just 100 out kf all 300 songs that i have saved.....
325: ado six times!!!
326: you are more otaku than i imagined xd you know a lot of that songs.
327: brooo i wonder what tf type of people are listening to ppap songmindblowing
328: back number 最高
329: i&#39;ve heared unravel, smiled, looked at nick, noticed he smiles too. i raised my brows, nick also raised his brows 2 seconds later. i feel weird
330: to be honest, the songs listed here are just the tip of the iceberg. there are so many more great songs in japan.
if it&#39;s okay to recommend them, i&#39;d like you to check them all out...
331: ppap is peak
332: babymetalのリアクション楽しみに待っています！❤
333: i acknowledge kenshi as a king of jpop, and ado as a princess of jpop.
334: top 100 most listened japanese songs:99 songs by japanese musicians1 by a japanese comedianppap is just a legend one hit wonder
335: damn yaosabi thou dominated this list

338: please check out tuki
339: ニキ、もしone pieceが好きなら、公式が出してるmr.childrenのheroの動画を見て欲しい。涙腺崩壊するから。あとサザンと宇多田ヒカルとb&#39;zは絶対に外せない
340: i&#39;m japanese. this includes some really popular songs. however, not all songs are truly popular, such as songs that have become popular on tiktok.
341: こう聴くとjpopってすげえや
342: bring some kdrama like squid game, weak hero class 1 and other reactions 🙏
343: 9:02 i thought his name was yuuri?? i got so confused
344: how would you not know ppap hahahaha
345: where was we are 😭😭😭
346: shocked to see only a couple yorushika songs appear on this list, always praying for them to get more recognition in the west. as a completely biased opinion i think all their songs deserve a spot on the top 100 songs in japan (obviously this is based on views but either way i love yorushika and i wonder if you&#39;ve reacted to some of their music yet. i dont have nearly the time to be watching back your streams, though i&#39;ve tried, and i wish i knew better what songs you have and havent seen.because if there is a possibility you havent seen their music videos, then that needs to change. also i really hoped i might see a keina suda song but i guess he&#39;s not that big to get a spot on the top 100.
347: there&#39;s a song you gotta react man. rasen / jon-yakitory feat. ado
348: how come orion by kenshi was not on the list?
349: babymetal yeah
350: babymetal yeah
351: babymetal yeah😂
352: brother, you should learn japanese right now.
353: 9:30 no way this song is in 69 i thought its forgotten lol this song is so majestic
354: 😮😊
355: 日本人からすると懐かしいなと感じる曲が多い
356: you should definitely check out one ok rock (a japanese rock band)! i&#39;m sure you&#39;ll love them!
357: ppapやばいwwww
358: maybe kinda without context but if you want a peak (okay, liam [creator] not have enough episodes to tell story in way he wanted) but if you want to watch a cool show that you can watch free and (for now, because is coming to a amazon prime) only on youtube, and im talking about murder drones… maybe not as brutal or scary as other liam projects but still amazing and one of the most popular show’s on youtube.
359: japan is just superior
360: the irony of number 17 &quot;usseewa&quot; by ado, because she was 17 years old when she released that song. just a fun little coincidence 😊
361: ニコラスさん、やっぱり大好き〜❤笑顔見てるとこっちも嬉しくなる😊
362:
363: 𝐌𝐀𝐗𝐈𝐌𝐔𝐌 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐇𝐎𝐑𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐄を聞いて欲しい！刃渡り2億センチも好評だったし
364: i love back number and sukima switch! oddly underrated in the westalso, i didn&#39;t realize just how popular kenshi yonezu and ado are
365: 24:56people know this as the rengoku song
366: top 100 of other countries would be fire too

383: back number has great songs nostalgic vibes
384: i am japanese, and while i am happy that i can understand the meaning of the lyrics of japanese songs as they are, i also feel sad that i cannot convey their meaning to people from other countries. however, i am happy when i see people who enjoy listening to the lyrics and are moved by them, even if they cannot understand them.

432: 7:44 tier 1 gooner
433: if i&#39;m not mistaken, around 2016 or 17, here in the philippines, ppap was all over the radio and tv. i didn&#39;t like it but it&#39;s so catchy it stayed on my brain until this very day.
434: w list🔥i’ll add them all
435: 33:44 remember this list isnt the top 100 best songs in japan its the most listened to songs
436: i&#39;m love it

438: 28:22 insane how such a good song could be apart of such a bad anime
439: 1:52 creepy nuts is so peak bro
440: ngl, was pretty surprised that not a single arashi song made it in the top 100. they were face of jpop for years and years. they&#39;re still ridiculously popular even now, five years after they announced their hiatus(and basically disbanded in all but name).
441: now that you done american reacts for hte title implication and explicit direct statement addressed, please do new yorker reacts and then new york italian reacts next 🫡😹🗣🔥!

452: 急なピコ太郎に笑ってしまった
453: that was awesome
454: thank you for your interest in japan.i&#39;m very happy as a japanese person.i can&#39;t speak english so i&#39;m using a translation site to write this. sorry for my poor english.i will continue to support you.nicholas&#39; smile always gives me energy. thank you very much🙇✨
455: day one of doubling the peak until nick watches neon genesis evangelionpeak
456: sakanaction live performance is the greatest thing i have ever seen.
457: in fact i still think that the peak of japanese music was from the 1980s to the early 2000s.japanese music is still very strong now, but the diversity and artistry are still a little worse than before.don&#39;t get me wrong, there is still a steady stream of outstanding young new generation singers, musicians or brand emerging, but just that era was better.the generation of japanese musicians and singers born in the bubble economic era really had a higher pursuit of art, their vision was above just pop music.the situation in the animation industry is similar, and even more obvious than in the music industry. the mainstays of the japanese animation industry today are mainly those who were born in that era.
458: 30:16 how the f you don&#39;t know kizaru who beat the axx of strawhats.😂
459: i love all of yonezu&#39;s songs because the lyrics are like stories.
460: なんだかんだでppapの中毒性一番やばい🤣
461: number 19 dry flowers have been coverd by ado and this song is amazing !
462: 18:53 ここ好き
463: imagine nick reacting to top 100 billboard songs in japan rn 🍏😂, would love to see a reaction to it tho 🔥🔥
464: please post the american one bruh
465: 6:39 kanade from sukima switch is the ending for one week friends, a fairly unknown romcom anime i watched a long time ago. i loved this song so much i was playing it on repeat.
466: japan is ichiban nick knows this
467: 0:47 first love is a song i discovered not a long time ago. it reminds me of 90s r&amp;b music
468: 海外ではadoやyoasobiが人気だと思うけど、日本国内で人気があるのは米津玄師とmrs green appleなんだよね
469: just letting you know, lists that include both youtube and youtube music are wrong. youtube music already includes youtube views, lemon should be like 4th or 5th
470: 29:47 the fckng whiplash i felt 😭😭😭
471: 17:44 🔥🔥🔥
472: 0:56 what&#39;s the name of that song
473: bro listen more hige dandism songs like pretender and subtitle....they are really good
474: i saw this video and decided to add every single song into my (private) playlistexcept for the sh yoasobi one it just stops my playlistexcept for shintakarajima that&#39;s been in my playlist for a real while nowfav new artist i found from that vid was official髭男dism
475: yoasobi, kenshi yonezu, and higedan is literally the japanese music modern era goat😂

481: maybe sometimes you can react ultraman or kamen rider song 😅
482: ppap was literally all of 2016 bro
483: suprised centimillimental wasn&#39;t on this list tbh. very great songs by him
484: so the song in the number 2 spot is called yoru ni kakeru (racing into the night) and i have learned the entire song and i don’t know any japanese
485: one ok rock 🤘
486: nick please do a babymetal reaction omg
487: ニコラスさんはアニメソングだけでなくて日本の歌謡曲(jpop)にまで聴くようになったのか🎵アニメやアニメソングは日本文化の入り口になってるみたいだね✨
488: この順位は間違ってる
489: 100位以下も面白そうだな。
490: ehm, actually it&#39;s american rapper reacts ☝🤓
491: ピコ太郎にポカーンしてるニキに爆笑してしまったわ
492: japan is crazy🔥
493: yes please do a babymetal reaction. they are so good!
494: 26:15 that’s exactly my thought whenever i’m watching japanese content and there’s no translation
495: i think not knowing what it says makes it more special. once you know what it says its gonna take away from it.
496: ppap forever
497: huge dandism&#39;s songs are so goated 7 of them are in the list
498: nicholas at the beginning be like: i&#39;m happy! nicholas at the end: wtf

500: 28:15 holy shit that means 3 songs in top 10
501: recommending “and return to white” by isekaijoucho
502: official hige dism took over the list 😭😭😭😭
503: which artist appeared the most? yoasobi?

511: one ok rock❤” the same as “❤❤
512: i generally don&#39;t comment on stuff, but, i love your videos. one of the few people who bring something when reacting to stuff

528: the long reign of pineapple apple was ended by a lemon.fruits in japan go hard.
529: honestly i wasn&#39;t expecting one ok rock to be on the list, but it&#39;s great to see at least 1 on the board
530: pls do a reaction of ado&#39;s cover of unravel

544: yes! sekai no owari rpg! i absolutely love that song. i love him and his band. and his vocaloid fukase too.edit: oh. i reaply thought yoru ni kakeru would be number 1. i mean, lemon is good too. but racing into the night is just better.

550: absolutely loved this video!
551: 30:07
552: lemon is number 2. yoasobi dominates it with a fuckton more views/listens combined.
553: ifdc for me the no. 1 will always be the op of noragami &#39;kyouran hey kids&#39;. i literally fell for this song the moment i listened to it for the 1st time back in 2k19 and ever since that day it&#39;s always been my phone&#39;s ringtone. every thing about this song is perfect be it the verse, beats, instrumental, bridge, chorus. but sadly it&#39;s under rated af at least the anime is if not the song
554: on my instagram i have a face swap video of that pineapple pen 😂

606: when are the bleach reactions are coming out................................??????????
607: this top just shows how much making a song that works on tiktok matters more than actually making a good song ,not saying all of them are bad or anything ,but to me creepy nuts has a way better song than the ones that are really popular now (they are just an example ) .
608: 15:46 i just remembered they perform in our country, in front of my face, and i thought they look pretty cute as fok only to discover that they are actually very famous 🤣.

617: the best part when at the end he started playing the &quot;top 100 american songs&quot; for comparison and felt embarrassed.
618: the thumbnail is so forced and cringe it made me cry from sadness.

625: 22:45〜the back number song has resonated with viewers with its lyrics that speak for unpopular men.the band&#39;s name also comes from the vocalist&#39;s self-deprecating experience of his former girlfriend being taken away by another band member.all their songs are about unrequited love and heartbreak.

645: i used to dislike listening to japanese music—until i discovered ado. since then, i’ve been captivated by her music, listening to all of her songs. she’s the only reason i started listening to japanese music. !!
646: レモンが1位なのは時代と、米津玄師本人がmvに出る過程など複雑な要素が絡み合ってメディアで大きく話題を生んだ。そして1番伸びた理由はカラオケで歌いやすく、若者から年配まで多くの大衆の興味をひいたこと。
647: thank you for listening j-pop!i hope you listen j-pop more.(please listen spitz and mr. children someday)

697: 米津玄師の曲をもっと聴いてほしいです！特に『海の幽霊』は私が今まで聴いた中で1番素晴らしい曲です！！『アイネクライネ』『loser』『感電』もぜひフルで聴いてください🙏
698: 日本人しか聞いてない曲で1番高いのがback number（とあいみょん）やな。海外勢がアニソンやtiktokの曲沢山聞いてる中、ほとんど日本人だけの再生回数で27位はバケモンすぎる。これが真のj-rockだよ
699: 日本の曲は詩的な歌詞が多いので気に入った曲だけでも歌詞を読んでみてはいかがでしょうか

747: masaki suda is a private friend of creepy nuts and has released song with them.kocchi no kento is masaki suda&#39;s younger brother, which was discovered after the song exploded.by the way, when i went to a certain high school for club activities, there was a student who had a ridiculously strong aura.he was later called masaki suda.

772: ピコ太郎で思考止まってんのほんとおもろい
773: ppapのリアクションに大爆笑しましたwwwww
774: this list is bullshit, misamo - do not touch has 118 million views, wtf
775: pikotaro and kizaru there is no sense of incongruity when putting them together.because uncle ppap and kizaru look so much alike
776: one piece ost sucksbut the best cartoon of the year😅
777: 近年日本でもkpop系のアイドルが量産されているけどこう見るとやっぱ全然聞かれていないなランクインしたのniziuくらいか逆に韓国のtop100がどれだけkpopアイドルで埋めつくされるのかちょっと興味ある
778: nicholas! watch &#39;legend of the galactic heroes&#39; (the old 1988 version). it’s one of the most legendary pieces of media ever made. if you enjoy anime like death note, code geass, or aot, you will love it. imagine lelouch vs. l in space! you have to watch it; it’s an experience!
779: 邦楽聴いて笑顔になってるニコラスを見るのが日課になってる!ｗ
780: meanwhile in the west...
781: fake rankings
782: ニコラス兄貴ほんと表情筋豊かすぎる
783: 28:47 big n just broke

791: いつかでいいから日本語を理解してもう一度聞いてみてほしい。翻訳したらは直訳されるけど日本語で歌詞をみたらまた感動すると思う
792: this was a fun video. just matching the songs i love from certain anime’s with the singers actual faces was great!
793: bring more bleach reactions if you want :d
794: i love ppap death note version. ryuk is funny as hell

808: bro i wish i can meet you when you come to japan:)
809: ppap was peak back in school in 2016
810: currently mrs green apple is the best band in japan
811: when kenshi yonezu creates songs for anime, i think he makes the melodies more catchy so that they’re easier for people outside japan to accept. “lemon” has a melody and lyrics that go very well, and i feel it reflects a sensibility that is closer to that of japanese people.
812: こういう動画待ってた!
813: mashle op being top 10 after only 1 year
814: 30:15 黄猿

821: 13:45 yesss please do back number reaction videos, their song is so good and it&#39;s so relatable😭🔥

829: i was surprised inferno was so high up! i figured when we saw mrs. green apple earlier that that would be about where inferno would&#39;ve been. i am happy it was so high on the list.
830: 絶対one ok rockは他の曲リアクションした方がいいぞマジでかっけええから他の曲とかアーティストを馬鹿にしたいわけじゃないけどアニメの主題歌とか流行りの曲ばっかリアクションしてるのは正直勿体無い
