178: 175: if you’re heading back to japan, there’s a massive warning about foreigners. thanks to some not so great youtubers that are disrespecting and disrupting everyone, some places are banning people of non-japanese descent. the japanese people are very meek and don’t fight back leading to people taking advantage of them. it’s also lead to a massive drop in japanese learning english. i know new york city has a japanese language program because i saw signs for it last time i was there basically they teach you japanese language. | Sentiment: None
179: 176: you do realize that no musical artist makes any money in japan at all. they get a portion of cd or e-sales but they barely actually earn anything. everyone does a standard 9 to 5 to make ends meet. artists only play for the love of music. it’s actually stated in the contracts they signed. it’s such a waste of labor. actors are also paid a certain amount which is why they have to do multiple acting jobs to earn a decent wage. they might do a live shot monday then go to a voice acting session tuesday then back again to live back to another voice gig or commercial shoot. it just keeps going through the week. most music artists in japan retire by age 35 because they can’t keep up with the wage issues. actors usually retire around age 45. it’s just a vicious cycle. | Sentiment: negative

191: 188: i think the songs that brother nicholas likes tend to have high-pitched parts, and it seems like high vocals are popular in japan too. but in this ranking, there were so many songs where it felt like, “ah, there’s a high note coming right after this part!” but then it didn’t quite get there—such a missed opportunity 😅i wish they’d show more love for japan. | Sentiment: positive
