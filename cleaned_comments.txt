1: ебаный пот рома жёлудь тут че забыл
2: where the hell is baby shark on this list?
3: 6:26 i think we all did man.so many of these are actually such iconic bangers though
4: 9:06 sadly, that song was made low quality on purpose (parody/comedy music), but the people in that time didn&#39;t get the humor and tought it was made in serious. now colibritany an her music is an internet classic, my favorite one is &quot;mami silicon&quot; or &quot;silicon babe&quot;
5: aka top 10 disliked justin bieber songs
6: wehren is wap bap from bibi
7: as a spaniard, i must tell you that “pollito pío” came out before “i wanna ride,” 12 years earlier to be exact.
8: this whole list is fake and bs none of the songs are the most disliked
9: baby is still bad dude.
10: 4:35 , he is right, its a banger &quot;untouchable, untouchableee&quot; but just that part, the rest of the song is ragebait
11: most songs are disliked because they have many views, but margin of like to dislike is hudge
12: the man who made the original video is definitely a justin bieber hater.
13: dont fucking @ me... justin bieber got way better after he got away from the heart throb kid image that was forced on him. love yourself, sorry, stay, ghost, peaches etc... all bangers.
14: i got leafy flashbacks at 8:30 lmao
15: i hate all of them, i was definitely part of the dislikes
16: justin bieber really got better with age his newer stuff is brilliant
17: 6:29 this thing is violating my ears 😭
18: i will never get justin bieber hatethis dude is so talented and have so many great songs
19: bro just put the most known songs in the video and called them disliked?
20: since it&#39;s just saying &quot;most disliked&quot; it&#39;s just going off the raw amount, not the ratio. if every song had 99% likes, &quot;most disliked&quot; just means &quot;most viewed&quot;. ratio is what really matters. but popularity still matters since there&#39;d be plenty 100% disliked songs that have no views. so what these compilations should really be is &quot;most popular disliked songs&quot;. a.k.a &quot;most popular songs that are ratio&#39;d&quot;. (over 50% dislikes) a.k.a &quot;the most disliked songs, that are actually disliked&quot; (take your pick)
21: e
22: brazilian songs in the list (we&#39;re kinda annoying 😭😭) musicas brasileiras na lista 01:09 metralhadora - vingadora (tays)01:27 baile de favela - mc joão04:50 tá tranquilo ta favorável - mc bin laden05:25 nhemnhem - maisa08:17 bang - anitta

28: problém is that pulcino pio was first bro soooo
29: where was wap bap from bibi with like 2m dislikes????
30: i understand why some songs are disliked. but either this video is half rage bait, or whoever made that video &#39;&#39;the most disliked songs&#39;&#39; is just an full on idiot, or just made is own opinion on songs. because how the fuck are some songs &#39;&#39;disliked&#39;&#39;
31: 4:57 he instant fading the smile and he heartbeat up to 93 in angry lmao

41: notice how there is no beatles songs
42: recking ball drama was about death of hanna montana and birth of new miley i think
43: a little bit of brazilian referenze about music 97, the video doesn&#39;t cover the hate part xd, but basically there was a girl who sings very very badly, alongside this main singer, doing voice like a cattle boiling water xd that&#39;s why it was hated a lot back on the days
44: bebar hater this guy who made this video
45: idk about you but i remember hating on justin bieber so much back in around 4th grade. turns out, his old songs are actually kinda bop and i now feel nostalgic listening to em.
46: nicki minaj’s “super bass” isnt talking about bass, its talking about “superb ass”. like she got a phat ass.
47: bro i love the first song, we bumpin ts all summer ❤❤
48: they need to make this video again but highest dislike to like ratio some of these songs are absolute bangers
49: naah man some of these songs are gold i don&#39;t understand this list
50: this list is fuckin wack some absolute bangers in here
51: 8:46 as a spnaish person this shit aint hated this is the goat of like spanish music viva gente de zona for making so many classics
52: how can people hate on judas, is literally one of the most iconic song of the last 20 years
53: 2:25 banger shakira never misses 😂😂😂😂😂
54: rebecca and justin were fighting demons lowkey
55: 13:06 what transformers guy😭
56: yea, all popular songs will have a lot of dislikes, even if it&#39;s a beloved song. being on this list doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything.
57: banger bangher
58: i came into this looking for thick of it
59: where is bibisbeautypalace with how it is?
60: it&#39;s crazy that he looks at all these pop stars with ghost writers and production teams who do everything for them (except sing) and shit like bieber who is literally just an industry plant and think any of it is at all good. it&#39;s all unoriginal trash. it&#39;s like loot boxes. they are fun because they are designed to target the parts of your monkey brain. no different than this over designed shitty pop music.
61: pollito pio is much more older than vegas, vegas was published on 2022 and pollitio pio on 2012
62: admita:você não esperava ver a maísa nesse vídeo
63: most replayed at 7:58? seriously?
64: 9:36 real!
65: 8:41 never heard this song that’s crazyyy
66: i cant believe this video made me realize 99% of justin biebers songs really werent that bad
67: the selfie song is the most shitty stuff human has ever created across all the entire human history
68: 19:45 so that&#39;s where jan böhmermann parody&#39;d xd
69: &quot;see you again&quot; hit hard in the cinema
70: 6:00 it&#39;s the &quot;ooh&quot; that&#39;s so annoying
71: randy marsh on 84
72: ahi also totally dont getthat wiggle wiggle shitngl😹🙈and wtf does little little twinkle star doing herelike wtf🤣
73: ohnepixel&#39;s vibe makes any song better lol
74: iswtg pulcino pio is fire
75: nicki minaj was hated bcuz the videos controversial cuz she shakes butt right
76: so wie photoshop
77: the message to take home is that &quot;more love comes with more hate&quot;
78: the justin beiber hate when i was young was forced. ngl
79: i love &quot;call me maybe&quot; 😢
80: love how he keeps throwing in random german words lol
81: they should make most dislaked by ratio not total amount
82: everyone had a crush on ariana ohne
83: i never really understand the hate with jb before (i was either too young to understand or just really don&#39;t see him as bad as they portray). anyways, it was before i saw a game in y8 website where you can drag a limpy body of bieber across the screen like hitting him on the walls. now that i have grown up, i realize that bieber was just as young and he went through too much media and audience hate. i feel really sad about thinking about it.
84: warum englisch
85: i get the point why most of them are hated because played in public so many times that hearing that shit for one more time is became unbearable when you are totally fine to play in repeat the same song or playlist for 10 to 20 times, but when it gets played everyday - you just can&#39;t hear it. this isn&#39;t about playes or views, this is about reverse mainstream effect.
86: ok so how did &quot;el pollito pio&quot; copy &quot;vegas&quot; if vegas was released 3 years ago and el pollito pio was realeased 12 years ago?
87: he is actually right at 17:17. if you speed up that song to 1.25x and slow the other one down to .75x the beats sound really similar
88: apored hater gehen international das darf die red army nicht zulassen
89: &quot;ok, ok, we hear you.. we will take the ratio into account now!&quot;&quot;stupid randoms.. the list not even change that much lol&quot;the entire list changes, half the videos aren&#39;t there anymore and the rest got all sorted out
90: this list is just bitter teen boys in the 2010s downvoting everything girls like
91: ??? there are so many bangers in here wtf do you mean most disliked songs???
92: cringe
93: 2:01 the like got disliked
94: who the hell hate twinkle star mf
95: the dislikes &quot;metric&quot; for this is a bit misleading. popular songs get a ton of likes and proportional amount of dislikes (usually 10%), so if a song is really big it would also garner a lot of dislikes even though most people like the songs. even normal youtube videos&#39; like/dislike ratios are like that most of the time.
96: this just shows we always hating on new stuff for no reason. cuz atleast half of these songs we can collectively agree on they are not bad at all.
97: no despasito !? this shiet is fake wth man !!
98: bro the dude who made this compilation is legit stupid. only displaying the dislikes but not the vies/ likes and ratios/ percentages speaks huge volumes about the copetence of that guy
99: 63 wtffffffffffffff
100: lil jon you cappin
101: ariana break free on the list i mean wtf
102: on the floor more like 6 foot under god daym

111: this guy clearly likes girly songs
112: i hate cs but i fkn love you
113: а где моргенштерн? авхавхха
114: 7:39 warum hast du eine bastighg stream liste
115: i can&#39;t believe almost all of jb&#39;s song are in here 😂
116: its actually so insane that apored made the list three times.
117: macht meinermeinung nach kein sinn bei 17:40 das ein 12 jahre alter song von einem 2 jahre alten song den beat kopiert?!? 🤔
118: i know almost 40% of the songs on the list soly because of &quot;weird al&quot; yankovich
119: 100xcopyright strike lmao.
120: bro 9:40 has me dead why did he get so mad
121: 7:02 is used for gta v life thug clips who rememebers hahaha , idk for me 12:53 the see you agein is sad , man rip paul
122: justin bieber was also something we called cringe when he was younger, but now it&#39;s really nostalgic and i&#39;m the biggest fan alive hahaha. also to all the other songs (almost), they&#39;re so good, they can&#39;t be hated.
123: 12:41 i get the rest of the songs being a bit bad or downright terible, but this, this is diabolical
124: 4:40 is just every gojo vs sukuna edit
125: nicki minaj and justin biber sucks as always but taylor swift&#39;s songs aren&#39;t that bad actually. also who the fck is rebecca black
126: where the freak is thick of it.hahhaha
127: 6:30 me too when i was young and she had that show playing kat on nickelodeon, then wokeness hit her.
128: ohnepixel brisando no baile de favela
129: &quot;metralhadora&quot; o que eu me ri quando essa tocou 😂😂😂
130: crazy how most of the song is my favs.
131: 7:58 i wonder why its the most replayed 🙏😭
132: some of these have genuinely bad or annoying production choices and then the rest are just... popular
133: 7 rings from ariana grande is from enter the gungeon (the soundboard)
134: how come you like one direction but not a fan of backstreet boys?
135: what i&#39;m surprised about is that there is no despacito in this mfking listedit: oh fk iits 8 years ago
136: lmao u see his heart rate go up when he talks about arianna grande. bro loves that girl
137: 8:20 just because shit is popular does not make it good... they get played on radio which 90% of the &quot;playerbase&quot; has to listen to during work because either headphones or earplugs are prohibited (causing massive dislike numbers because most of these songs are shit)
138: why the fuck is baile de favela dislike 😭
139: you are right for 18:10
140: i was waiting for thick of it to be in first place
141: miley cyrus here like every 5 song
142: most of them sound more like a song than nowadays top liked...

151: misletoe is ❤‍🔥though
152: i dont personally listen to bieber but hes just a dude that can sing really well. hate feels mega forced
153: wap bap would be #2 on this list lmao

170: what about &quot;wap bap&quot; by bibisbeautypalace?
171: bro not the reaction obviously but this video is so biased or like ohne said it&#39;s like that 1% out of so many likes that it&#39;s one of the most disliked but there are just sooo many bangers or songs that are not that bad and some are indeed bad even few justin bieber songs aren&#39;t that bad too.
172: mto engraçado ser br e se deparar com mc binladen, baile de favela, maisa cantando e anitta kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
173: i&#39;m just gonna say i literally listened to scream and shout like few moments ago even though i haven&#39;t listened to it in a while and you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s hated?????
174: i think most old lady gaga songs have aged quite well
175: no is a banger only last 1/3 tho
176: on first place shoulded be timati with his most disliked video on youtube
177: nah bro tweakin&#39; on the elsa that shit is objectively so spammed its garbage

179: 7:31 if you listen to 7 rings hardstyle it actually makes it even better.
180: 7:31 bro i so agree, but in secret tho
181: all these songs fall into one or multiple of these categories:people who have done shit that&#39;s questionable, controversial or despicable shit or thirst choreography with intentional camera anglesrepetitive lyricsoutfit choice, or lack ofsongs that are just hated by all adults but adored by all kidssongs with shit lyrics, lack of choreography and an over used melody, but just worksgot famous after mum uploaded a song on youtubedisliked because woke viewermy thoughtswho the fuck is rebecca black, i cant stand bieber either, and nicki minaj is the thirstiest of them all

262: bro these songs are bangers
263: &quot;it&#39;s a bop. but it&#39;s a not special bop&quot; is the best possible way to describe a lot of these songs. especially blurred lines.
264: meu país mais uma vez se destacando, mesmo por ter musica ruim, vai brasil🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
265: the hills is a hated song wtf?
266: let us be honest. all this hate to bieber came just from jealous guys who never had hundreds of millions of girls going wet just looking at their picture or hearing their voice. bieber lived their dream. objectively looked, bieber was a very good looking guy and good singer and his songs also were a quality production (i mean technically good, but also catchy). same goes for many boybands. backstreet boys was loved by girls and hated by men. take that, same story. and so on. men called them f*gs and pussies etc. but simple thing is that they were just good looking, good singing and extremely popular ....yeah sure, of course i would very much like the same kind of attention from beautiful girls they get. but that does not mean that i start to lie about their musical and artistical quality ....where the hate to miley cyrus comes from i do not know. she is an amazing singer and superbeautiful incredibly sexy woman .....
267: bapwap from bibis beauty palace would be the 2nd most disliked song but its only 7 years old 💀
268: the meghan trainor one, there is one part thats a banger, i think thats what u were talking about but it was at the end of the song so u prob missed it

325: (comment before watvhing) im guessing this list is bullshit considering there&#39;s like 3 bangers in the first 5 lol

368: 17:17 digga bro, das ist im radio läuft ein kuken, hattest du keien kindheit? kennst du das net oder wie.... like damnnn
369: rebecca black had the biggest music glow up ever zho
370: most of them are disliked more for the video (and sometimes just for the singer themselves) than for the song itself
371: where is burger pommes 💀
372: they forgot bibis beauty palace wap bap (3.6m dislikes would be 2nd place)
373: why people hate justin😅
374: jb era crazyyy
375: young justin bieber didn’t deserve the hate man.
376: transformers icant
377: 1 out of 10 songs here are justin bieber
378: hes comparing el pollito pío to i wanna ride 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
379: the thing about justin bieber is that he has only 3 good songs:what do you meanboyfriendlove yourself
380: 2nd spot shouldve been bibisbeautypalace&#39;s &quot;how it is&quot; with 3.6 mil dislikes...nvm this video is a year older than the song.
381: half of the list is actually bangers...its insane.
382: first thr list is not updated despacito i think is number 1 or baby shark
383: apired being already hated that much back then is crazy, wonder how much dislikes it got now
384: photoshop offiziel schlechtester song deutschland mit bürgerpommes

389: basically every justin bieber song that exists
390: 4:57 the music changed genre so quick😂. and his face like “da hell is that doing here!?”😂
391: but i think many ppl hated just to hate and cus it was everywhere. like that song “apeatu” or smth. forgot the name. but i hate it. like hate hate. but i think its only cus its everywhere, so by time it gets super annoying.i remember like 8-10 years ago everyone either loved or hated on justin bieber. and he was always main topic when someone talked about music ;-; i dont have anything against him tho. im just not fan of his music. im more to heavy metal😅
392: nahh maroon 5 - suger gives nostalgia xd
393: i was waiting for bibisbeautypalace wap bap but the video is too old 😭
394: people hating on gummy bear song have no lives

398: the list is trash. where is bibis how it is???
399: tell me its charts from 2010, i would believe it so far...
400: bruh, should have rated by likes to dislikes ratio, not most dislikes over all. like a song with 2mio likes and 10k dislikes is obviously better then one with 100k likes and 5k dislikes...
401: how despacito is not in this lol?
402: the reason we hated jb as a kid is hilarious now. baby is a banger tho. it&#39;s in my palylist back then
403: justin bieber songs were like the early and end were good but the middle phase of his career is nah for me
404: poeple really do be hating twinkle twinkle little star
405: i used to hate on justin back in like third grade because everyone did and now in hindsight i have no idea why or when it started

408: baby has 16 million dislike the guy is high
409: you hating superbass is racist
410: this is the worst top 100 ever made
411: rebecca black and justin bieber fighting for the number 1 spot
412: im in luve with da coco
413: the reason a lot of songs are here is because they are either extremely popular, overplayed, genuinely bad songs, or just something females enjoy.
414: one direction is straight heat and anyone who hates is still on a 10 year old bandwagon
415: they should of actually put songs that were hated and not just disliked on youtube , i can say this, the hills and a hand full of other songs being on there, shows no real effort was put into this. but hey, easy content for the raw channel hehe
416: 1:10 meudeus vey o &quot;pega a metralhadora&quot; eu vejo como relíquia 😭😭
417: 5:32 ele falou caraca??????????
418: 1:26 e brazino el juego de esta era
419: 4:40 fr
420: baby baby baby oilthe most disliked song
421: i used to hate justin bieber back then before i learn to make music myself. but now his music is why he is famous. he make really good song. his live performance is crazy good. much respect
422: we used to hate jb and one direction just because we were jealous and envy them for their famous and all girls love them, but few years after i started love them and listening to their songs and i wished many times one direction back together again
423: 8:06 - 8:10/11 yep! o7
424: jb always treated his fans like dog shit, the hate he had &amp; has is deserved
425: how can you hate twinkle twinkle little star 😭😭
426: i only realize now how absolutely sickening the hate against justin bieber was. he was just a kid trying to make a name for himself. boys hated him because girls crushed on him, and everyone else was just jealous because he was young and successful doing pop music. he was a child. even tho i was never a fan, it was hard watching people sh*t on him like that
427: the disrespect to pollito pio
428: i like super bass xdd
429: justin bieber was and is fine i don&#39;t understand the hate lmao
430: how was despacito not there
431: well rebecca black has an unfortunate story. she got harassed so much as a kid for the friday song it’s insane. people calling her, death threats, lost her friends and got bullied. just for that song lol. it’s badly produced sure but it’s not like it was a serious, just teens making dumb song.
432: no rickroll?
433: “if you know, you know” 🗣️🔥
434: i donno why most of these are hated. these are common contents of playlist of people around me on these song&#39;s times.
435: where&#39;s thick of it?
436: holy this list is literally half justin bieber, even his good songs get dislike bombed 🤣
437: karma jojo siwa
438: love how this includes justin bieber&#39;s entire discography lmao
439: wait el pollito pio was way before that song 18:06
440: 18:10 😂😂😂 nah this not it
441: where was baby shark?💀
442: his heart rate increases to a lullaby lol 4:57 , some bad memory ?! :d
443: i think he needs to learn the difference in samples, interpolation, remakes, covers, etc...there is also different kind of samples. :&quot;d
444: justic beiber got bullied
445: i did like justine&#39;s and one direction&#39;s songs back in the days even though most people said they were trash. i find songs by them in that era were much better than the ones they produced later which, nobody seems to hate.
446: 笑鼠
447: 18:00 u trippin bro, that spanish song was realesed way long before vegas
448: i never hated justin bieber for his music. i just have an absolutely massive hatred for his personality and the way he treated his fans. don&#39;t know how he is now, but the damage is done in my book.
449: can you do more music compilation video reactions. the ‘media ranker’ channel has some great ones 👍
450: wo ist wap bap von bibi mit 3,6 millionen dislikes???
451: justin bieber is the best wtf...
452: 16:05 because everyone used to hate on one direction and justin bieber just for the sake of it, including myself - now that we&#39;re 10-15 years older we can just see the songs as songs without the peer pressure of &quot;it sucks&quot;
453: 8 years old, he gotta do a newer vid of this
454: lol the world opinions are too toxic
455: judas disliked? the fuick
456: prime miley cirus or prime kim kardashian
457: the amount of times we saw justin bieber and nicki minaj on this list is just crazy 😭
458: 100 copyright claims done 💀💀💀💀💀💀
459: justin bieber was literally the goat of pop
460: this disslike list is older then wap bap.
461: justin&#39;s songs are soo good , the only reason people hated were because he had controversies in the past and we all know diddy was a part of justin&#39;s trauma.
462: i was expecting to see baby shark and despacito around top 10 but nah it didn&#39;t appear and also surprise to not see bts not even in top 100 wow
463: bro how does your heat go over 100 on a song video
464: justin bieber was just a kid…
465: get many dislike cause it sound bad xget many dislike cause have lot viewer ✓
466: people don&#39;t hate justin music because they him because of his fast growth in his career, always he is best 😎
467: 18:48 this is criminal zayn is literally the best why is he even on the list
468: justin bieber rules
469: hating on judas is a crime
470: многие в этом топе из-за того что у них много просмотров, но в процентном соотношении у них мало дизлайков
471: nah nah nah 18:00 cmon you have to know you sound german you shouldve known and it is older
472: they didnt include another german youtube masterpiece which is &quot;wap bap&quot; by bibisbeautypalace sitting at 3.6 million dislikes
473: many songs are very good. i think the ratio between dislike and views makes an unfair chart
474: those are fine good old songs with lots of memories. nowadays pop songs are mostly similar vibe not very versatile
475: bannngaaa 1:21
476: 2:12 this dude from russia 😂 he is freak for most people. i didn’t know that english channel will add this russian boy 😂
477: there is so many justin bieber&#39;s songs i didnt know they existed
478: some of the songs are there just because they are too popular 😂
479: wo ist wap bap von bibi?
480: 17:17 - ... the original, a brazilian some kind of meme
481: alot of these arent that bad ngl
482: 10:30 &quot; best song ever&quot; got most dislikes 💀
483: back then, people legit wanted to kill that mf jb
484: where is wab bab
485: how is bound 2 so high on this list
486: ngl after hearing that justin bieber is being groom during that time. the hate is kinda overblown imagine what that young adult think when he release that song while being ** by the industry.
487: 17:45 2012 song vs 2022 song??? 😂😂
488: since when is music for women or man? music is unisex. 😒 girly?
489: where the fuck is &quot;how it is&quot; - bibi h? 3,6 million disslikes!
490: didn&#39;t expect the real rabbit to be in there 3 times
491: bro where tf is wapbap, it has 3,6 million dislikes
492: jb topping the charts.
493: 15 minute video to 24 minute 👏👏
494: 3:26 bro had no idea who rebeca black was but instantly knew the song friday by her 🤣
495: morgenshtern - пососи (official video 2020) 2.7 milenjoy
496:
497: calling the songs bad was due to the early to mid 2010&#39;s having great songs so the standard was higher to see similar quality songs nowadays is rare.
498: despacito didnt even make the list? its like the most popular song in youtube no shot it doesnt have more dislikes than jb
499: i think justin bieber is the reason why youtube hid the dislikes
500: wap bap :(
501: 18:00 he is confused because the same song got translated into german and was running on tv ads all the time lol.
502: 18:15 bro has lost it 😭
503: the disrespect against justin bieber years ago was crazyyyy
504: ohne thinks shakira and ke$ha are the same person?
505: apo red ist crazy bro
506: 0:51 whoever is responsible for this is a criminal, this song fucks hard1:00 alright 3 songs in i&#39;m reporting the original video1:27 as a brazilian, words cannot express how deeply offended i am by this song being in this video
507: some of these songs arent bad it just those people who doesnt have taste in music they probably listen to gang songs lmao
508: nicki ruins any song she&#39;s in
509: 24:20 like how can you hate this songi actually love it
510: el pollito pio is older than that tiktok song tho...
511: going by number of dislikes is stupid, there will always be more dislikes on a song that is more popular than another, it should be decided on a dislike to like ratio or a dislike to view ratio.
512: charlie poot! charlie poot!
513: this has both my favourite songs in it and the ones i hate the most
514: justin bieber single handedly owns most of the hated videos or smth
515: what about despacito it also has 6m dislikes?
516: i fucking love ohne bro
517: 12:34 that song has been disliked that much because it&#39;s the wrong version. ♂

537: bailando poland
538: bibi h - how it is ( wap bap ... ) | 3.6 million dislikes. why not in the list
539: 4:00 german doesnt exist , the closest name similar to that word is of a dead nation
540: 4:02
541: just wondered why the is no bianca heinicke wap bap bc it have 3,6 mio dislikes to but ist from 2017 sadly
542: 7:29. the instrumental&#39;s go crazy on this song.
543: where was how it is by bibi? 3.6 million dislikes.
544: we will never forget apored den aller echten insimodus akitivierenden main character. may he never return to germany.
545: bro until i was like 6 or 5 i thought my brother made uptown funk, and told my friends
546: ohnepixel´s heartbeat at 15:40 increased🐩
547: man this made me add like 6 katy perry songs to my spotify, where is she❤
548: lmao no.1 at 6 mil dislikes xd
549: justin bieber didn&#39;t piss me off back than but his fans pissed me off
550: 9:20 yes ohne it´s exakt like this. would be more interesting to get a like to dislike ratio
551: thick of it - ksi??
552: surprised no nickelback people use to hate on them
553: i never knew shakira and rihanna had a song together wtf
554: where is ksi think of it?
555: 17:05 defenetly last 2 generations we have right now xd
556: 6:25 💀
557: 6:26 💀
558: where the fuck was wap bap... it has over 3.5 mio dislikes
559: ну рома выдал
560: why u dislike black songs
561: wap bap robbed
562: а как же тимати с москвой, моргенштерн со своим пососи?)
563: i was here in chat and he was asking for suggestions and i said most hated songs and this is one of the only times a streamer has ever reacted to something i&#39;ve put in chat
564: why is 7:55 the most replayed😭
565: 7rings balkan remix is the best
566: where is &quot;despacito&quot;?
567: so good 🤣🤣
568: jb’s old songs are still not really my thing but his recent albums are actually good
569: was no one alive in 2012 in his chat bruh, howw does no one know the chick song
570: 7 rings this sounds like a typical cringe tiktok songhow can anyone like this🤮🤢
571: 3 segundos de video e ja tiveram 2 musicas brasileiras. its over
572: i know that song of 7/11
573: wheres wap bap by bibi
574: 18:30 bro is onto nothing 😂
575: 14 years and justin bieber - baby is still the most disliked. i remember the dumbass flash games around justin bieber because how much everyone hated him 🤣🤣
576: who is hating coco??
577: 4:58 the disappointment on his facefam
578: wonder what we seen more of justin bieber or miley cyrus lmfao
579: i got a feeling this video miscalculated by solely going off the quantity of dislikes rather than the proportion of likes to dislikes. no shit a song with 1m dislikes and 20m likes has more dislikes than a song with 200 dislikes and 100 likes. it&#39;s just that proportionally, a ratio of 1 : 20 is smaller than a ratio of 2 : 1.
580: lmao like 20% of these were young justins songs, thats crazy
581: whattt how is the hills by the weeknd hated ????
582: do most liked songs now
583: 11:46 josh where the bass? joooshh wheres the bass!?!?!?
584: 16:17 this guy fell from a balcony and died, i think his name is liam payne
585: everyday saturday remix absoluter klassiker
586: where&#39;s despacito?
587: wie kanns sein, dass wap bap von bibisbeautypalace nich hier drin is, das müsste auf platz 4 sein
588: rebecca black sounds like a name for a pornstar but not a singer
589: 12:46 i love how pressed he was during the charlie puth&#39;s section.
590: i was expecting rick roll buy anyways
591: this video just unlocked core memories (el pollito pio and what does the fox say)
592: most of theese songs got disliked because they disliked the artist therefor made up their minds about their songs without probably listening to it.
593: 2:20 no goddamn way
594: crazy that the nae nae guy killed someone with an axe
595: jb carrying this listactually goated
596: german reacting to justin is crazy
597: 13:13 perfect pitch guy but no personality. i cringe so much song is good but charlie is whack!
598: 6:27 you are not the only one so don&#39;t feel lonely
599: 1:29 4:20 13:12 14:12 17:11 18:40
600: now it&#39;s almost impossible to hit 6 000 000 dislikes, because they are hidden, so people think they will do nothing. justin biber can be officially claimed as the most hated singer on the planet earth ever.
601: right title: ohnepixel reacts to justin bieber&#39;s most hated songs
602: gamnamstyle is perfect
603: 18:45 where to copy bro the chicken song is nearly 13 years old
604: chalii puut
605: i liked when he said, i used to have a crush on ariana.
606: (shitty song comes on)ohne: ohhhh its a banger
607: they are sorting it by most dislikes on video but in reality they should be sorting it according to the ratio of likes and dislikes
608: did bibi delete her song or was this before the song campe out? i could swear it had 2 million dislikes
609: government dislike coco
610: where is despacito
611: the audio files in the chat is crazy 💀
612: 12:46 bro i haven&#39;t even watched the movie, but i still know that its from fast and furious.
613: 8:26 that sh*t wild af 😂🤣
614: idk what is it but bieber has some bangers fr
615: more view = more dislike no shit
616: many of the songs aren&#39;t bad, more like mediocre.it&#39;s just they were played so much every-fucking-where until you hate them.
617: most disliked songs: aka every jb&#39;s song from his teens and early 20s.
618: you can&#39;t hate on lady gaga
619: anti spiral
620: where is wap bap from bibi. it would be #2
621: 13:17 we all know charli pooth and transformers lol
622: done pixel
623: how is despacito not here???
624: one direction it´s actually a really good band
625: 22:18 this video did that song dirty, cuz they should have showed jb part
626: ohne you trippin trippin nvm
627: 10:31 that was a forced hate my bro 💀🙏
628: 9:40 shittiest take so far bro.
629: 4:01 apored jumpscare
630: who the fck hates one direction?
631: these people need to put on some clothes sheesh
632: where is wap dap by bibi? it has 3,6milion dislikes
633: my mind is still in this time i swear
634: &quot;i just don&#39;t like this one&quot; ohne why do you think it&#39;s in the video
635: 1:29
636: junge das da apo kam hat mich so gebrochen😂
637: best music german underground techno !
638: bro does everything but play cs2
639: full of bangers🔥🔥
640: i finally found k-pop19:23 psy19:59 psy...22:49 psyyy24:13 again psy
641: thick of it 😂
642: lmao this is just all the justin bieber song basically
643: i like how some of them just stun him into no commentary like 5:42 lmao
644: salio del madrid y no hizo nada porque no pudo sin florentino y sus goles en fuera de lugar
645: does he not understand the concept that a song that is very popular will have many dislikes (in total number) too? the video is about total dislikes, not like like/dislike ratio or smth. so ofcourse a song with 500 million views is gonna be on that list somewhere.
646: this video should be titled &quot; ohnepixel react to most disliked justin bieber and other artist&#39;s song &quot; tbh

653: 90% of the songs are disliked for no reason tho lets be honest no ? :d
654: wab bap von bibi hatte doch auch 3 mio dislikes??
655: hating on &quot;let it go&quot; is a war crime
656: sometimes i can&#39;t tell if he&#39;s actually that goofy or just acting
657: i think they should make like dislikes to likes ratio like u know it has 10 times more dislikes than likes etc
658: nah, but the jump from 2.1m dislikes on 2nd vid to 6.2m on the 1st is hella crazy
659: rebecca black did a boiler room set xd

674: hes right its populare hate it should be rated by percentage wise
675: based pixel, everyone hates this song bcs its popular&gt; next song omg its so bad this song
676: i think they need to put a like/dislike ratio on the songs, and set a views filter like ＞1m views, so we can truly get which one is more hated instead of just putting random popular songs
677: no mika - relax take it easy.. pff fake list, 15 years or so ago, you walk the street and hear 6 different people blasting that stupid song from their phone in your radius.

686: looking back, i actually was a jb fan and liked &quot;baby&quot; a lot, probably had it in a playlist called &quot;best music&quot; or ill--egally downloaded the track because i liked it so much. ....impressive that the realest bunny apo r-e-d made it into a compilation like that. sad what fame does to a man... maybe in 10 years he can come back to germany after the statute of limitation has expired, for now he will chill in dubie, uae and istie, türkiye. sleeping in different apartments payed by others, promoting and advertising ponzis and pyramids, while his wife and children chill in germany on government bürgie-basis.
