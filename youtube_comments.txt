18: Their best songs come from some of the most complex emotions, and tempered by cultural norms and expectations.

76: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1410">23:30</a> for your information, NiziU was a jpop group under Korean entertainment company called JYP Entertainment<br>You should try listen some of their songs

88: Well, not the 100 songs most played in japan, but the 100 japanese songs most played around the world hahaha
89: were are asian kung fuu ?
90: His face while listening to Unravel got me.
91: The amount of anime songs here is kinda wild. Imagine that over here. “Among the 100 most listened songs is everything miley Cyrus, Michael Jackson still, the most recent Ed Sheeran, gravity falls op, powerpuff girls op, samurai jack op, gravity falls wierdmaggedon op, owl house op”<br><br>lol
92: PPAPクソワロタwwwwwww
93: unravel のリアクション好きすぎる。この言わなくてもわかるだろ感　dude I love your reaction when unravel plays
94: The fact that Yui, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Tofu Beats and Chanmina aren’t on here is wild to me
95: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=163">2:43</a> this song made me cry like a baby when I first listened to it. Instantly became one of my all time.
96: Lessgo Yoru ni kakeru and odo and lemon and many others ha
97: Love ado💙 one of my favorites<br><br><br>Love the rest too❤
98: You should watch the music video of number 88. Its titled Niji (Rainbow). Its about life after marriage. And also its a Doraemon movie theme song where Nobita and Shizuka got married.
99: PPAP is the best song ever. <br>BTW, that troll song singer is actually a comedian. He had series of these and well know in Asia for his non-sequitur humor. (it&#39;s not monty python... but more like a subdue benny hill)
100: Should prob point out these songs are top due to anime (for the most part).<br>It is not only Japanese people listening to these, but just anime fans in general, so quite frankly it is probably a large amount of these streams being western.
101: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1244">20:44</a> natori MENTIONED!?!!!🔥🔥🔥 natori for the president

112: I am Japanese. I use a translator to make comments. I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s a strange sentence.🤖💦<br><br>&quot;lemon&quot; is the theme song of the drama, a song that sings painfully about the sadness and loss of a loved one, and became popular because Yonezu&#39;s own family&#39;s death had a significant impact on the production and many people sympathized with the lyrics.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you seem to be having a good time! Thank you for listening to Japanese songs.🥳💖

134: Tbh, I prefer Kenshi Yonezu&#39;s Orion waaaaaaay more than Lemon...

138: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=2026">33:46</a> The song Lemon actually has a much deeper meaning that I think everyone can relate to

154: Bad songs
155: Nick should do a reaction to Pen Pineapple Apple Pen. It&#39;s a classic
156: Didn&#39;t Oda confirm that he based Kizaru on the PPAP guy?
157: Yes, u gotta hear baby metal x bmth
158: Nicholas, I have a favor to ask you. Please watch the live video of Sakanaction&#39;s song &quot;Music.&quot; The pleasure will send you to heaven.
159: Ohhh PRX vs Heretic early
160: Nico-Niki, you really seem to know almost every song!! Impressive! Appreciate you showing love for Japanese music!!

170: It&#39;s the most forced reaction I&#39;ve ever seen ☠️
171: watching the stupid anime watchers weebs in the chat mad is my favorite part
172: i cant belive tuki bansanka isnt here.... T-T
173: Pretender by Official higedandism is one of my favorites, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s on #6
174: Taishō Sugō aka Masaki Suda played the very smart yet confined Phillip in Kamen rider double/ W. He was the wizard in the Shazam movie although he overdubbed lines translating into Japanese.
175: If you’re heading back to Japan, there’s a massive warning about foreigners. Thanks to some not so great YouTubers that are disrespecting and disrupting everyone, some places are banning people of non-Japanese descent. The Japanese people are very meek and don’t fight back leading to people taking advantage of them. It’s also lead to a massive drop in Japanese learning English. I know New York City has a Japanese language program because I saw signs for it last time I was there basically they teach you Japanese language.
176: You do realize that no musical artist makes any money in Japan at all. They get a portion of cd or e-sales but they barely actually earn anything. Everyone does a standard 9 to 5 to make ends meet. Artists only play for the love of music. It’s actually stated in the contracts they signed. It’s such a waste of labor. Actors are also paid a certain amount which is why they have to do multiple acting jobs to earn a decent wage. They might do a live shot Monday then go to a voice acting session Tuesday then back again to live back to another voice gig or commercial shoot. It just keeps going through the week. Most music artists in Japan retire by age 35 because they can’t keep up with the wage issues. Actors usually retire around age 45. It’s just a vicious cycle.
177: I didn’t realise how big hige dandism is but ofc cos they only make bangers
178: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1963">32:43</a> &quot;depression pop&quot; 😂
179: I loved when Da pump when they made the song called &quot;If&quot;.<br>so much nostalgic song is in this list and Im happi.<br>its not like best its most watched so its not only japan, people from other countries watches them too dont forget that.
180: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=461">7:41</a> My dad gym song that i added (he&#39;s japanese)
181: Evangelion OP was defeated by &quot;you are my special&quot;, how the hell did this happen?
182: Japanese Top 100 Destroys All World Top Lists
183: LOL HTF is Pineapple Pen number 5?? HOW??!! Well sad that none of the newer Bleach songs were up there but at least there were a couple older ones lol.
184: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1789">29:49</a> Kizaru jumpscare
185: Me seeing Rokudenashi in the list. I&#39;m happy
186: How is ponponpon not on the top played list
187: So I kept track of all the Yoasobi and Ado songs. Yoasobi had 9 songs (2 of them were #3 and #2). Ado had 6 songs in this whole list. I kept track of these two cause I like them the most of all the jp artists
188: I think the songs that Brother Nicholas likes tend to have high-pitched parts, and it seems like high vocals are popular in Japan too. But in this ranking, there were so many songs where it felt like, “Ah, there’s a high note coming right after this part!” but then it didn’t quite get there—such a missed opportunity 😅<br>I wish they’d show more love for Japan.
189: I expected the whole of Twice&#39;s Japanese discography to be here lol.. ig maybe because they&#39;re not a Japanese group
190: Your face at the number 5, i pied myself ^^
191: PPAP by Kizaru 😂
192: Japan bros you have some great fucking taste.<br>Also, PPAP was a crazy curveball 🤣
193: I like that in Japan musicians often use instrumentals and are not afraid to play with their voices. It also seems that Japan has the kindest and most positive music.
194: Is it more biased? Considering he didn’t like the others much unless it was mostly anime, or maybe he just likes mostly soft spoken songs?
195: wooo proud Japanese/American moment for me. Glad you enjoy our stuff (minus PPAP lol)
196: nah.. you dont even know what  we do to take over ppap from the top..<br><br>you dont even know fruit wars
197: ニコラスよ。<br>日本のネットミームも見る気は無いのか？<br>日本の裏の顔「変態」を楽しめるよ
198: Just a tad happy here that YORUSHIKA had a couple on the list.  You gotta check out their music!

209: I&#39;m a Japanese teacher and I seriously want to teach you Japanese. You have a high level of comprehension, so I&#39;m sure your interpretation would be amazing if you learned Japanese.
210: Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen xd

221: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=2018">33:38</a> “Lemon” is a song produced in 2020 as the theme for a television drama. The lyrics beautifully reflect the drama’s themes, and together with the show’s popularity, the song attracted significant attention. It also served as the breakthrough that brought the artist Kenshi Yonezu into the public spotlight.
222: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1817">30:17</a> “Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen” is a song written and performed by the Japanese comedian Pikotaro. Its surreal humor made it a hit in 2016, and it later became a sensation in the United States as well.
223: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=622">10:22</a> Masaki Suda（菅田将暉） is a famous actor in Japan, and he’s also a talented singer.

251: 私は日本の米津玄師さんのファンです。<br>私が言うのもなんですが、このランキングに出てくる米津玄師さんの歌う曲は、全て米津玄師さん自身が作詞作曲をして歌い、ディスコグラフィのジャケット絵も描いています。さらに、菅田将暉さんの歌う「まちがいさがし」、DAOKOさんと共に歌う「打上花火」の作詞作曲も米津玄師さんが行っています。<br>僕は米津玄師さんは努力と才能の神だと思ってます。

263: So fun fact about PPAP song, that song was the most viewed j-song for awhile 😂 i watch 1 channel breakdown month by month how much view every song get and the community in that channel so pump up surpassing that meme song lol😂😂
264: I&#39;ve watched and listened to anime/Japanese music since I was a kid in the 90&#39;s and I don&#39;t think I recognized many of the songs on this list at all lol except for a few obvious ones on Demon slayer, JJK, Naruto. I think I must just have terrible taste in music lol The Japanese band I&#39;ve probably listened to the most was introduced to me like 15-16 years ago called &quot;Mass of Fermenting Dregs&quot; but besides that it&#39;s like 80% City pop music which I thought would be more popular than it actually is too.
265: I see you didnt know what number 69 was. Its called &quot;yesterday&quot; and its from a very underrated anime movie called &quot;hello world&quot;.
266: Most Artists Appearances: TOP 6<br><br>1st Yoasobi - 9 songs<br>2nd  Kenshi - 8 songs<br>- 2nd Hige Dandism - 8 songs<br>3rd ADO - 6 songs<br>4th Mrs Green Apple - 4 songs <br>- 4th Back Number - 4 songs<br><br>These 6 Artists make up 39% of the entire top 100 list!<br><br>Edit: Also, kenshi does appear as a feature on another song, so you could say he had 9 songs, but I felt like features don’t really count so I didn’t include it!
267: Racing into the night by yoasobi is number 2 on this list despite being shadow banned on yt due to self harming themes. Maybe that is why the copyrite on that song is very lax.
268: My boy Kizaru was spitting 🍎🖊🍍🖊<br>😎 <br>👔👉✨  🍎🖊🍍🖊<br>👖<br>👞👞

300: 這些歌曲大部分都非常好聽！該把它們放進音樂清單裡面了！
301: I&#39;m so sad there was no Sheena Ringo :(
302: Something I like about Japan&#39;s top 100 compared to the western world. <br><br>Their music and taste isn&#39;t formulaic. If you were going through a western top 100, you&#39;d already hear about 10 songs that sound the like they used the same footnotes, same melodies etc. Here we have a list of ppl just listening to whatever tf they want and you&#39;re seeing the variety reflected on the list. Every entry is a completely different vibe than the last.
303: Overreact
304: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=366">06:06</a> YES! PLEASE DO BABYMETAL! They&#39;re crazy good, especially in live performances

323: lemonが人気なのは日本語の歌詞と、テーマソングになったドラマの完成度です。Netflixにあるので、ぜひ「アンナチュラル」を観てほしいです。日本をよりリアルに苦い視点で知ることができます
324: I don&#39;t know which one to put where, they were ALL in my playlist already this whole freaking time.<br>Am I Japanese then? And thats just 100 out kf all 300 songs that i have saved.....
325: ADO six times!!!
326: You are more Otaku than I imagined xD you know a lot of that songs.

328: Back number 最高
329: I&#39;ve heared Unravel, smiled, looked at Nick, noticed he smiles too. I raised my brows, Nick also raised his brows 2 seconds later. I feel weird
330: To be honest, the songs listed here are just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many more great songs in Japan.<br>If it&#39;s okay to recommend them, I&#39;d like you to check them all out...
331: PPAP IS PEAK
332: BABYMETALのリアクション楽しみに待っています！❤

341: こう聴くとJPOPってすげえや
342: Bring some kdrama like squid game, weak hero class 1 and other reactions 🙏
343: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=542">9:02</a> I thought his name was Yuuri?? I got so confused
344: HOW WOULD YOU NOT KNOW PPAP HAHAHAHA
345: WHERE WAS WE ARE 😭😭😭
346: shocked to see only a couple yorushika songs appear on this list, always praying for them to get more recognition in the west. as a completely biased opinion i think all their songs deserve a spot on the top 100 songs in japan (obviously this is based on views but either way i love yorushika and i wonder if you&#39;ve reacted to some of their music yet. i dont have nearly the time to be watching back your streams, though i&#39;ve tried, and i wish i knew better what songs you have and havent seen.<br>because if there is a possibility you havent seen their music videos, then that needs to change. <br><br>also i really hoped i might see a keina suda song but i guess he&#39;s not that big to get a spot on the top 100.
347: there&#39;s a song you gotta react man. Rasen / jon-YAKITORY feat. Ado
348: How come Orion by Kenshi was not on the list?
349: Babymetal yeah
350: Babymetal yeah
351: Babymetal yeah😂
352: Brother, you should learn Japanese right now.
353: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=570">9:30</a> no way this song is in 69 i thought its forgotten lol this song is so majestic
354: 😮😊
355: 日本人からすると懐かしいなと感じる曲が多い
356: You should definitely check out ONE OK ROCK (a Japanese rock band)! <br><br>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll love them!
357: PPAPやばいwwww
358: Maybe kinda without context but If you want a peak (okay, Liam [creator] not have enough Episodes to tell story in way he wanted) but If you want to watch a cool show that you can watch Free and (for now, because is coming to a Amazon Prime) only on YouTube, and im talking about Murder Drones… Maybe not as brutal or scary as other Liam Projects but still amazing and one of the most popular show’s on YouTube.
359: japan is just superior
360: The irony of Number 17 &quot;Usseewa&quot; by Ado, because she was 17 years old when she released that song. Just a fun little coincidence 😊
361: ニコラスさん、やっぱり大好き〜❤笑顔見てるとこっちも嬉しくなる😊

384: I am Japanese, and while I am happy that I can understand the meaning of the lyrics of Japanese songs as they are, I also feel sad that I cannot convey their meaning to people from other countries. However, I am happy when I see people who enjoy listening to the lyrics and are moved by them, even if they cannot understand them.

448: JPOPの海外布教に一役買ってるやろニキ

Sorry for my poor English.<br><br>I will continue to support you.<br>Nicholas&#39; smile always gives me energy. Thank you very much🙇✨
455: Day One of doubling the peak until Nick watches Neon Genesis Evangelion<br>Peak
456: Sakanaction live performance is the greatest thing I have ever seen.
457: In fact I still think that the peak of Japanese music was from the 1980s to the early 2000s.<br>Japanese music is still very strong now, but the diversity and artistry are still a little worse than before.<br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, there is still a steady stream of outstanding young new generation singers, musicians or brand emerging, but just that era was better.<br>The generation of Japanese musicians and singers born in the Bubble Economic era really had a higher pursuit of art, their vision was above just pop music.<br><br><br>The situation in the animation industry is similar, and even more obvious than in the music industry. The mainstays of the Japanese animation industry today are mainly those who were born in that era.
458: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1816">30:16</a> How the f you don&#39;t know Kizaru who beat the axx of strawhats.😂

467: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=47">0:47</a> First Love is a song I discovered not a long time ago. It reminds me of 90s R&amp;B music
468: 海外ではAdoやYoasobiが人気だと思うけど、日本国内で人気があるのは米津玄師とMrs Green Appleなんだよね
469: just letting you know, lists that include both youtube and youtube music are wrong. youtube music already includes youtube views, lemon should be like 4th or 5th

551: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1807">30:07</a>

553: IFDC for me the No. 1 Will always be the OP of Noragami &#39;Kyouran Hey Kids&#39;. I literally fell for this song the moment I listened to it for the 1st time back in 2K19 and ever since that day it&#39;s always been my phone&#39;s ringtone. Every thing about this song is perfect be it the verse, beats, instrumental, bridge, chorus. but sadly it&#39;s under rated AF at least the Anime is if not the song

577: Yuuri was one of the first Japanese artist led me into J-pop, he was too underrated.

This is a message of gratitude from one Japanese person to Nicholas.<br><br>(I&#39;m sorry if the translation was incorrect.)
591: Eveさんの曲来たら待ってましたと言わんばかりのいい反応をしてくれるから見ちゃうんだよなぁ<br>ほんとにニコラスニキの言う通り新曲を待ち焦がれています❤<br>マジで全人類に聴いて欲しい…

606: when are the BLEACH reactions are coming out................................??????????
607: This top just shows how much making a song that works on Tiktok matters more than actually making a good song ,not saying all of them are bad or anything ,but to me Creepy nuts has a way better song than the ones that are really popular now (they are just an example ) .
608: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=946">15:46</a>  i just remembered they perform in our country, in front of my face, and i thought they look pretty cute as fok only to discover that they are actually very famous 🤣.

625: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1365">22:45</a>〜<br>The back number song has resonated with viewers with its lyrics that speak for unpopular men.<br>The band&#39;s name also comes from the vocalist&#39;s self-deprecating experience of his former girlfriend being taken away by another band member.<br>All their songs are about unrequited love and heartbreak.

646: レモンが1位なのは時代と、米津玄師本人がMVに出る過程など複雑な要素が絡み合ってメディアで大きく話題を生んだ。<br>そして1番伸びた理由はカラオケで歌いやすく、若者から年配まで多くの大衆の興味をひいたこと。

762: ニコラス兄貴には、THE BLUE HEARTS聴いて欲しいな～。
763: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=2023">33:43</a> it’s the opening to a very popular reality tv series that’s popular in a crap ton of asian countries if I remember correctly.

777: 近年日本でもKPOP系のアイドルが量産されているけどこう見るとやっぱ全然聞かれていないな<br>ランクインしたのNiziUくらいか<br>逆に韓国のTOP100がどれだけKPOPアイドルで埋めつくされるのかちょっと興味ある
778: NICHOLAS! Watch &#39;LEGEND OF THE GALACTIC HEROES&#39; (the old 1988 version). It’s one of the most legendary pieces of media ever made. If you enjoy anime like Death Note, Code Geass, or AOT, you will love it. Imagine Lelouch vs. L in space! You have to watch it; it’s an experience!
779: 邦楽聴いて笑顔になってるニコラスを見るのが日課になってる!ｗ

791: いつかでいいから日本語を理解してもう一度聞いてみてほしい。翻訳したらは直訳されるけど日本語で歌詞をみたらまた感動すると思う
792: This was a fun video. Just matching the songs I love from certain anime’s with the singers actual faces was great!
793: Bring more bleach reactions if you want :D
794: I love PPAP Death Note version. Ryuk is funny as hell
795: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=1596">26:36</a> Ranked 17th like her age when she debuted with this song

809: PPAP was peak back in school in 2016
810: currently mrs green apple is the best band in japan
811: When Kenshi Yonezu creates songs for anime, I think he makes the melodies more catchy so that they’re easier for people outside Japan to accept. “Lemon” has a melody and lyrics that go very well, and I feel it reflects a sensibility that is closer to that of Japanese people.
812: こういう動画待ってた!
813: mashle op being top 10 after only 1 year

Would genuinely love to see you check out all his full songs on his channel 😂 Pretty much every single one is an absolute bop and they all hit in very different ways (especially if you watch the pvs!)
818: 急なPPAPに混乱してるの面白すぎる
819: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=943">15:43</a> 49 and we got the first idol song. Really hope the top 50 isn’t dominated by idols.<br><br>Coming back to say it wasn’t. Thank you Japan for not being totally idol pilled.

829: I was surprised Inferno was so high up! I figured when we saw Mrs. Green Apple earlier that that would be about where Inferno would&#39;ve been. I am happy it was so high on the list.
830: 絶対one ok rockは他の曲リアクションした方がいいぞ<br>マジでかっけええから<br><br>他の曲とかアーティストを馬鹿にしたいわけじゃないけどアニメの主題歌とか流行りの曲ばっかリアクションしてるのは正直勿体無い
831: it’s really sad for u that u think some anime really can beat this iconic tokyo drift ost, tf u on monkey??!!
832: vid so good it made my day brighter
833: Yoasobi owns the list ngl

850: It&#39;s not top 100 now.. it&#39;s ever
851: Nick, please continue the bleach TYBW reaction, Even if it was a full reaction without the scene and sound.
852: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZavL1dJDiDI&amp;t=407">6:47</a> &quot;Hai Yorokonde&quot; by Kocchi no Kento is a fantastic bop and I&#39;d love to see your reaction to it! It was quite the trend to do the chorus dance in Japan as well! The description of the song provides a decent idea of what the song is about as well and it&#39;s quite the relatable one!
