350: 346: shocked to see only a couple yorushika songs appear on this list, always praying for them to get more recognition in the west. as a completely biased opinion i think all their songs deserve a spot on the top 100 songs in japan (obviously this is based on views but either way i love yorushika and i wonder if you&#39;ve reacted to some of their music yet. i dont have nearly the time to be watching back your streams, though i&#39;ve tried, and i wish i knew better what songs you have and havent seen.because if there is a possibility you havent seen their music videos, then that needs to change. also i really hoped i might see a keina suda song but i guess he&#39;s not that big to get a spot on the top 100. | Sentiment: positive | Score: 0.964
